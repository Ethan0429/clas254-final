<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">So today we're going to start on on
Roman epic of a difference, but it's not too much of a break, but I
want to start over time. OK, I want to start with a quote that I came
across as prime minister. This is from a book on Roman epic, it's a
guy named David Cay Johnston is a scholar of some note on Catullus,
and he wrote that the term epic in modern usage connotes heroism on a
large scale. And the notion of a short epic suggests forced or
unnatural compression like a bonsai tree or a miniature Shetland.
Catell, a sixty four, has a dense, abbreviated quality as though it
contained too much in too small space. It is nervous like a
diminutive breed of dog. It's like the visual there. What do you guys
think about that now, you've seen miniature epics. We've seen a
couple of them actually free. So the idea of a miniature epic isn't
new. But what about Catullus? Do you agree with David Konstanz
assessment of it? Is it a miniature breed of nervous dog sort of
Chihuahua trying to act like it's tougher than it actually is? Or is
there some sort of thematic unity here? Is there some reason that can
tell the. Obviously, there's a reason, but what do you think that
might be? Is there some unifying theme here? This is kind of buried
or is he trying to talk about a theme in a very, very roundabout way
through these series of disconnected episodes? Break up. Think about
five months. Think about that. Think about the story. Think about how
the story moves from one scene to the next can tell us. It's hard to
tell. Sixty four is hard. It is. It's not the most straightforward
form. It is not supposed to be. He is drawing very much on the
Hellenistic tradition. And if I go back. Wow, I'm. Go forward. If we
look at one Catullus, right, this is at the very end of the republic,
remember, run this red bar here, Roman history is riding right at the
very end of the Roman Republic, which is actually the very end of the
Hellenistic period. When we looked at Columbus here, the other
Hellenistic epics kind of trail off into the middle Hellenistic. But
this is about as late as we've seen. So if we think about Catullus
and the literary tradition that he's writing in, it's actually very
late compared to the other epics. That's really early for Roman and
Roman literature. But in terms of the Greek models that he's using,
he's drawing on Kalinich, he's drawing on Apollonius, he's drawing on
these Hellenistic authors who are trying to really dismantle some of
the older ways of looking at that, because it's not about the hero,
it's about the other characters. It's not about the moral virtues
that are really obvious and right in front of you. It's about the
moral virtues that are not stated as directly about the ones that are
modeled, but perhaps not said out loud. So that's what catalyses
drawing. And to really understand where he's coming from and what
makes this particular poem interesting in the history of Roman
literature, we have to understand what comes around to tell us. And
it's kind of weird to think about this is actually as late as it is
in the Republican period here. It's actually the earliest complete
Roman epic that we have. There are a few earlier ones. We have Levius
Andronicus. We wrote a version of The Odyssey and we have another guy
named Nijhuis who wrote a history of the first war with Carthage on
the Belenko. You'll sometimes see Portakabins felt differently, but
that's old and they're coming from the third century B.C. So there
are a couple of centuries before Catullus. It's interesting to know
where these guys are. They're not writing in Rome. They are writing.
And so we call it Roman. They're writing about Roman history. So
again, Roman epic that they are not themselves from Rome. Lidia's
Andronicus was born in a Greek city in tandem with Italy there, and
it was actually a Greek slave taken to Rome in one of the military
conquests. He gained his freedom and became an author and began
writing plays, comic plays, mostly now comedies entrance, actually,
and at some point decided to write an epic. So he wrote this odyssey
in the third century. And shortly after that we have Naidus or
Naidus, who came from the other side of the. The boot of Italy,
they're not quite the tow, but another companion city down there, so
not Latin. And it's interesting that both of these guys started
writing probably because they started writing tragedies and comedies
and epics, probably because of their connection to the Greek cities
just a little bit further south on that cultural context was how the
epic spread into into Latin literature. So when you look at Levius
Andronicus, it's an adaptation of The Odyssey, but it's a short
adaptation. It's the septillion form that was really popular at the
time. It's just a single book. He's taking the entire odyssey and
condensing it down into one book. Of which we have a few dozen
fragments, so we don't really have enough to to get a feel for what
he's doing with the epic or the narrative, but we know that this is
what he did. We have knives, has come along a few decades later
writing about the first war. This is the first of three. He lived
through the first war. He fought in it for Rome. And he is writing
about what he remembers. He's writing about the people that he knew,
the people that he fought with and for and against. And he is
layering these these historical scenes with mythological ones. So
he's tracing the history of Rome from the fall of Troy. All the way
up to his present day, this is kind of where Virgil would get his
idea later to trace the history of Rome or the foundation of Rome,
rather. From the fall of Troy, Nijhuis is the model for that and a
lot of ways he wrote a longer epic, it was seven books, but we're not
really clear on his division. He didn't even divide it into seven
books. So he seems to have had a rather complicated organization. And
it's not like he had the mythological scenes at the beginning and
then the historical scenes later on, he's weaving the two together.
There's a historical scene and a mythological setting and historical
scene with the logic. So he's leaving the two of them together. And
what this does is it kind of breaks down the barriers between what
the Romans would have considered history, living memory and what they
would have considered very old mythology, especially since that
mythology is largely borrowed from the Greeks. And that's important.
Now, before I talk about the next guy who was even more important in
the development of ethics, I'll just give you guys a little
illustration of how different this was, these earlier ethics where
they had a. You're kind of on a pedestal in Roman literature and in
Roman philosophy and and the upper circles of Roman society because
of their early date, but people didn't like reading them as much in
later periods. They were not as influential in the way that they told
the story because of their meter, because of the way physics
literally the way that they told the story. Now, when we look at
Greek epic, especially older Greek epic, I remember I read you guys a
portion of the Iliad I think it's written in a very specific Meeta
Meter is the rhythm. So when we think about the The Iliad or the
Odyssey or the Heckerling even, it's always in the same year. It's
this long line with short syllables and long syllables arranged in a
way that we call hexameter ductility. Examiner, you need to know
that. But just remember the sound of it, right? Name the night air
that allows lemonade is flowing kind of sound old Latin epic is not
that we can either pause in the name playing the prognostics pause
pithiest Apollo. It's a very broken way of constructing the
narrative. And it had its effects, this is apparently how early on
song song. This is a poetic device that we see not just in Italy. We
see it all over. If you look at old old English, Anglo-Saxon poetry
like Beowulf, this is actually the form that it's the Old Norse and
Icelandic sagas are written in this form as well. It's a little bit
different, but basically you have this break in the line and what you
see on one half of the line can be mirrored on the other. So, for
example, down here, I can't reach that. Arquit, the names matches the
Sogeti sorry, these are the arrows and this is him holding the bow.
This is the word Fa&ccedil;on. This is the name of the son. So what
you have on one side matches the one on the other. But there's a
confining quality to this to. You don't have the room to really sit
in a whole lot of formulas, you can have short formulas that occupy a
few well, maybe a half of a line, but the lines are very short. So
these long extended formulas that you have in Greek epic, you don't
get those in old Latin. The a lot of the formulas, if you think back
to the Iliad and the Odyssey, they have to do with the name of a
father in the first line of the Iliad. You don't have a killable you
to have a name. But he's also Achilleas, the son of Pelleas
patronymic. The name of the father is really important. It's
important for mortals. It's important for gods. That's something
that's really important in Greek culture to know who the father is.
Again, it's the the Greeks built up their idea of who people were and
how you should relate to them based on their genealogies. The Romans
didn't do that. So the names of people, those patronymic and the
formulas that go with them, they don't translate it. And so all of
those formulas get dropped when you start looking at Latin, meaning
that's really important for a lot of what we're going to see in
Catullus. Now, we don't have a lot of the CIA or the Pentagon. We do
have more still fragmentary of the next author here. He wrote his
analysis in early second century here, and he, too, was from southern
Italy. It was from the field in Calabria down there. And Linnaeus was
writing a history of Rome as well. But he started while he also
started with the joint and he went down to his own name, which began
in one eighty nine BCE, and then at a later date, he decided to go
back and add three more books. Now, this tells us something about the
structure of this epic. It was flexible. It wasn't something like we
see with the Odyssey, which had been kind of codified by this point
to have a certain internal consistency. Everything has to be for
books. Those four books have to mirror each other on opposite ends of
the of the narrative. Any is designed it in three book chunks. But
those three books were scalable. You can move them around. You could
add in more if you needed to at a later date. Now he too is drawing
on great traditions. He famously said that he had three hearts or
minds. Why? He's using the word here in Latin. The mind is in the
chest and the heart. So it's kind of like he had three of them. One
was great. That's the culture that he grew up in. One was &Ouml;zkan,
the language, his native language that he spoke growing up. And the
third was Latin is his adopted culture. And the Romans conquered
southern Italy. The cultures in that area became Westernized. And so
this is his adopted culture. So he's combining these Greek things and
the Greek style of writing and the great traditions of literature
with his native folklore and with Latin. That is Roman history. And
he's calling it the he's not giving it a grand title basically
translates to Chronicle. This is supposed to be an account of what's
happening, but it's an epic. Now, he claims a lot of promise and
claims a lot of authority for himself among peoples far flung, my
subject and potential and renown is one of these fragments. So he's
writing this expressly to become famous. That's pretty flat out, but
it's how he's writing it. That's interesting. If we look at the Latin
here, Lofthus Tatopoulos s quitclaim with an extra Vladek. This is
not this attorney. This is not that short broken line. This is the
Greek for this is that dactylic hexameter. So he's not just adopting
adopting Greek concepts of literature. He's adopting the very way
that the Greeks are writing. This is not something that sounds really
impressive to us today. I realize that. But for a Roman audience,
this was a big break. This is very clearly something that is not
Italian, that's not Roman. This is something that is very clearly
Greek. If you were reading this in the second century. Now to
emphasize how different he is trying to be from earlier authors, he
goes on to say, Others have written of the war, that is the Punic
War, the war with Carthage inverses, that once the funds and Bardes
used to sing, when neither the rocks of the Muse's nor anyone before
this man, this man being himself was conscious of style, that is the
old meters as old broken lines or what people used to sing random
songs. And it was the song of Shepherds Off in the Hills. It was the
song of drunken revelry. It's not a polished style that ethics should
be. Now, this matters when we look at what he was writing about and
he's writing a history he's interspersing, he's not Interspeech
sorry, he's not interspersing the theological tradition with the
historical tradition. He's starting at the beginning and he's tracing
it on to his day. He's doing all of it as if the mortal's were
themselves on the same level as the divine. And that's a pretty big
shift. Is glorifying human achievement as if these achievements
themselves raise the people up to the level of these. Now, this makes
sense when we think about how the Romans thought about gods, this is
not the way that the Greeks thought about gods. This is not the way
that most religions today in the world think about the relationship
between mortals and gods. This is a kind of a Roman theme here.
There's this idea of a divine continuum, and you start at one end
with the major gods. You go all the way down to the very lowest of
the low and mortal human society. And so if we look at the plebeians
or the lower class, the patrician's of the upper class, you have some
groups in the middle here, they're on a continuum based on wealth.
How much money you have, the more money you have, the more powerful
you are. Pretty straightforward connection in Roman society. But. If
if an upper class person who has money, who has power, who has
authority to do something in society, does that thing really, really
well, and if they win enough glory in doing it, they can somehow
transcend the bonds of being just another person. And all through
this, the people who were exceptional in Roman society somehow became
something more than just people they could enter the realm of maybe
not the major gods, not even the lesser gods, but they could somehow
become a little bit more supernatural. And so what NASA is doing is
he's taking some of that, he's taking advantage of that, but that's
the basis of what is right. He's taking those exceptional people that
he knew in his own experience, Romes not that big of a city at this
point, the legends that had been passed down to him and he is making
these people, these ordinary mortal Romans are not extraordinary
mortal, Romanes, on par with the heroes of Greek mythology and the
gods themselves. This is a pretty big shift. And he has this quote
that kind of wraps up why he's doing this on ancient customs and then
the Roman state stands for. The people that he's writing about did
such exceptional things that they safeguarded not just the city
itself, but they expanded Roman territory, they expanded Roman power,
they made Rome what it was. And these ancient customs that they
practiced, the people themselves, were what made Rome the power that
it was Rome in any day was not quite this. It had declined a bit in
his own view. And so what he needs is writing. It's not just an
effort to try and chronicle what is what happened in Roman history.
He called it the last. But that's not quite what it is. It's a moral
example to it's a moral example to Romans of his day to follow the
example not of average ordinary patrician's, but of the people who
have transcended that. They've done really great things to make Rome
into something more than just a city on bank of a river somewhere.
And if Romans can do that in his day to, then Rome can be even more
than it is. And so it's that moral example that we see in every. He's
not just chronicling. He's trying to get that morality across as
well. But he's doing it with ordinary soccer. It's extraordinary, but
still very mortal people, which is something the Greeks did not do.
Now, if you look at where this these things are happening that the
three ethicists are writing about, it sort of chronicles the
expansion of the expansion of Rome, Italy, and then into Carthage and
the western Mediterranean and then especially into the east into the
greatest. So just looking at how these epics are recounting Roman
history, we see the expansion of Roman power and authority throughout
the Mediterranean. Again, it's not just about history. It's about why
that history happened, layered with the mythology and the morality
that went with it. And so for that reason, we can't really separate
Roman epic from politics and history throughout all of Roman epic.
The political situation in which the writer, the author is writing is
really central to how they are forming their mythologies and their
histories. Politics is always present in Roman epic in a way that
it's not in Greek. It's a really, really big shift. And it says
something about the Romans perception of themselves if they are
writing about themselves on par with the gods. That's not how the
Greeks saw themselves. There was always this division between the
Greeks that were alive in the day when their writing and singing
these songs and the Greeks who were alive way back in the heroic age
age that lost and will never come again. But the Roman authors from
the very beginning here are intentionally breaking down those
barriers. They're taking the Greek forms, but they're working in
actual Romans into the structure in a way that we don't see before.
And so when we read the texts. They are about a mythical past, they
are about a historical past, but they are supposed to say something
about the. When you read about Roman epic, you come across the idea
that Roman epic and Roman literature, a lot of it is a palimpsest,
palimpsest is something like this. In an age before paper, what
you're writing on is actually skin vellum is usually skin or skin
shave very thin. Sometimes you can see through it and then it's cut
into squares and used just like we use paper, except it's very
expensive. You don't want to waste it. So sometimes you have a book
that no one's reading anymore and you take a very, very sharp knife
and you try to scrape the off of it once enough of the ink is off.
You can reduce it like this. The larger text here was the earlier
text. It was scraped off and not completely at least. And then this
later text, smaller text was written on. We know about a lot of
authors from things like this where they didn't they just didn't
scrape off quite enough of the ink, which is fortunate for us. But
it's also important to keep this this metaphor in mind when we think
about Roman literature, because what's on the page in front of you is
requiring you to have a lot of background knowledge in your mind. The
palimpsest in this case is the relationship between what you're
seeing in the text and what's underneath it. But what's underneath it
is literally underneath it. Of course, it's what's in your mind,
what's in the mind of the audience and the reader that's informing
their interpretation of the mythology, the history, the individual
people, the saints, the everything that you're going to see, some to
have, meaning they're not just flavor anymore. They're symbols a lot
of times. So you're supposed to read into these things. They're
supposed to be referential. They say one thing, but the audience is
supposed to interpret something else. So when we look at Catullus,
it's important to remember that political nature is writing about
Greek mythology, not writing about history, which is actually a break
in his day. Most efforts that Roman epics up until Catullus were
written about Roman history and Catullus. Right. So this is really,
really popular. And then people begin to shift to writing about
mythology. It wasn't just Catullus, other people started writing
about mythology, too, but you begin to have a shift at the end of the
Republic and into the early empire, but from history into mythology.
But it's still political. It's all about politics. So when we read
Catullus, that's what we need to think about it. And it's not just
the mythology. It's not just the Greek context and stories. It's the
Roman politics as well. So let's look at the narrative and it was a
little confusing, so let's go through it a little bit and try to
figure out what happens. And you have to start at the beginning
somewhere, writing about some impasse. We've seen this before. This
is something that happens when a nemesis to whose wedding nemesis is
not invited. She rolls the Golden Apple into the wedding and the
goddesses start to fight over it. I told you the story. Right. And
that sets in motion the judgment of Paris, which sets in motion. It
sets in motion the Trojan War. This is one of the central myths, the
central stories of a lot of Greek mythology. A lot of mythology pours
out of the meeting of feelings and thoughts. So Catullus takes that.
But he starts it with the voyage of the Argo. He was on the Argo and
Apollonius approach to. We just didn't see him in the passage that we
read. But he's there and it's on this this voyage that he needs. He
needs to get us. And then it jumps to the wedding. There's no real
transition there, they meet, they fall in love. What Catullus doesn't
say is there's probably like a 20 year gap there and then suddenly
the wedding. So there's a large break of time in the original
mythology, but we jump to the marriage. Although are we actually
seeing the marriage? Doesn't really talk much about the marriage.
What does he do first before we even get to the marriage? ARIADNI.
We've met ARIADNI before. Remember when Jason was in caucus talking
to the media, trying to convince her to help him, he keeps making
these awkwardly inappropriate references to Species of Theseus, an
area Ariadne's is for a girl who gets abandoned on an island after
she helps Theseus kill them in and escape from Crete. Natsu Jason
decides to invoke when he's talking to media. Lets us know in the
context of the Ark and Atika that things are not going to end well.
In the larger mythology, this there's a lot more going on here, and
Catullus chooses this moment to jump into that story. So he's talking
about the marriage bed on which really something or two which
believes that he will retire at night and on this bed is read this
embroidered blanket. And the embroideries shows in a series of scenes
here, The Myth of Theseus, an area that is Ariadne being abandoned on
the island of Naxos and getting her revenge on Diciest and then being
rescued by the God Barcus Roman God, Bacchus, Greek God diagnosis. So
he inserts the story here and he begins it not at the beginning of
the story, not with the scenario at the meeting, but with everybody
being abandoned on the beach and discovering that she's alone and
being blinded by rage and madness. Madness is the word he used. She's
she's angry, obviously, but she's out of her mind and she cannot
control herself or her thoughts. And then what? So we start with
everybody on the beach. Then he goes back and recounts the rest of
the story. So this is that in media and media's race thing, we saw
this with The Odyssey. We begin toward the end of the story, a little
story you could get in the mouth and then we trace backwards from
there and we stop or we transform from there and we stop you
backwards in time. We pick up the beginning of the story, then we
stop again and then we resume in normal time. We see this in The
Odyssey. We see this in a lot of other epics, too, and we see this
here. So he starts the cartela starts the story of Ariadne with her
being abandoned at the end. Then he goes back in time and recounts
how Theseus in this telling lures her away from Crete. He tells her
that his love she's obviously in love with them and she to your
brother, he convinces her to abandon her family, go against her
father and her family, her people in much the same way that we saw
Jason convincing the DIA to do the same. So there's an intentional
parallel that he's constructing here. That parallel is only is only
obvious to the reader. Well, it's not really obvious to the reader at
all. It's only made evident to the reader because all of this is
nested within the story of the wedding of place and say this place,
who was on the aagot right at the beginning of the poem, he talks
about the Aagot. References that in the second line, the lines from
Palin's peak swimming through Neptune's waters, pines that were used
to make the ship. So with that knowledge in mind or with that
reference in mind, everything else flows from that that reference is
supposed to kusin to think about Jason Amadiya. So don't lose her
away from Crete after he kills the minister. And then I'm sorry, the
exploits of this is on great. And then he inserts another story. So
this is the rise and fall in love to go against your family, then he
kills the Minotaur with her help, then we pause again. We go back in
time again to pick up the very, very beginning of the story where
Athens loses a war with Crete and is required to send a living
tribute of sons and daughters to create to be sacrificed to the
Minotaur. It was also some. Technically, Ariadne's half brother. And
the king of Athens, I guess, who we met in college, and that's the
father of Theseus, the king tells us that if he should return home,
if he should be successful in killing them in Qatar and freeing
Athens from the city, he should fly a white sail instead of the dark
blue sail that Marwell usually translated black into that it's
actually dark blue in the light, the dark blue sail that that the
creten ships usually sail. So if the if these raises the Weitzel as
the ship approaches Athens, I guess we'll know that it's successful
if it's a dark sail. I guess we'll know that his son is dead and then
all hope is lost. Theseus begins to raise that sail so it sails into
into Athens Harbor with this black sail, I guess thinks that he's
dead and throws himself off a cliff to kill himself again, thinking
all hope is lost. The reason that he does this is why why is Catullus
telling us this story? Why do we care about idiots at all? Ariadne
curses these things, right? Why does she curse events or why does he
abandon her? She says it once, it's not really obvious he forgets
about her. This version of Theseus is very flyte. His mind is I think
it's compared to when things go basically the Roman equivalent, if
things go in one ear and out the other, nothing sticks in the middle.
So everything that Theseus hears from his father, I guess from
ARIADNI, from the gods, it just doesn't stick. He has a very bad
memory and it gets him into trouble and it gets everyone around him
into trouble as well. Theseus forgets Iggy's instructions because he
just forgets them, he forgets about ARIADNI on the beach because he
just forgets her, she's not important enough to be remembered by
Theseus. This is not the same as what we see in Greek constructions
and the myth where Theseus has other plans in mind and he just wants
to go on and do other things in ARIADNI would get in the way. This is
Catullus version where Theseus is just a forgetful character and so
this is forgetting his father's instructions and ultimately leading
to his father's death. That's the divine punishment. For leading
ARIAD, so when everybody prays to the gods, the furies to avenge her,
to punish Theseus for his forgetfulness of her, this is the
punishment. That's why Catullus inserts this story within a story.
It's the justification for the punishment that's about to happen.
It's letting the audience know that ARIADNI will, in fact, be
avenged. And then because people like happy endings, we get Ariadne
being rescued, the God Baucus just happens to be on the island of
Naxos. Naxos was a wine producing island in the ancient world. So it
just happens to be on the island when Ariadne's abandoned there. Here
is this girl screaming and crying on the beach and he goes to see
what's going on. He falls in love with her and rescues her and takes
her up into all of us. All right. So Ariadne gets rescued and then
that's the end of her story. We go back to the wedding and the
wedding guests arrive. OK, so ARIADNI has the story. There's a story
about Theseus into Ariadne's story when we return to the wedding
guests, the wedding guests arrive. We hear a few of their names. They
come with their own mythologies, their own references that I'm not
going to bother unpacking. There are references here to, again, the
Jason and the Argonauticas. So the center Karen arrives, who taught
several of the Argonauticas, taught Jason himself. We hear about
Prometheus and we've met a few times before who has now been freed by
zoos and allowed to come to the wedding. And then we have the face
also coming, they are saying they are the entertainment for the
wedding. We don't hear about the wedding itself, the actual marriage.
Right. But we get the fake singing at the wedding. And what do they
sing about this son, Achilles? And the reason they sing about
Achilles is because that's the whole reason for the wedding. It's not
really discussed much in to tell us here intentionally because he's
holding off on that. Until you get to Achilleas. The whole reason
there's a mortal marrying a goddess is because there was this
prophecy by Prometheus that that is would have a son who is greater
than than his father. Whoever married Thanis was going to have this
amazing son, very strong, very powerful, very brave, who is going to
do either really amazing things or really terrible things. And if we
think back to the great construction of heroism, great and terrible
or kind of late. So Zus was afraid of this, he realized that if any
God that is, that the son would potentially overthrow the whole
cosmic order, the whole divine order, sort of like how we saw with
commodity cycle. And so he rushes very quickly to marry Thetis off to
a mortal because the most powerful mortal in the world can't possibly
overthrow the gods. It's not an actual threat. This is his way of
taking care of that prophecy and making sure that nothing bad comes
of it. So that's why the states are singing about Achilles, it's not
just the sun that's going to come from this marriage, it's the
resolution to this prophecy that the audience would've known about.
And. In the course of this, they also sing about Achilles, Troy,
Detroit, they sing about Achilles death and they sing about another
girl, Polixeni. And did you catch Flexner's? Barely referenced here
either. Her name is tossed out. After Achilles diocese is in one of
the later epics that we don't have much preserved of Achilles's kill.
He's killed by terrorists at the walls of Troy, Paris, as a poisoned
arrow that hits Achilles heel and kills her Achilles and buried the
Greeks fight on. They eventually take the city. And after the Troy is
destroyed, Achilleas ghost appears to the Greeks. And he says that's
one of the daughters of Priam girl named Polixeni had apparently been
promised to him as a bride before the war ended. How that happened is
not explained, but apparently this was supposed to happen. And since
Achilleas is now in the underworld, he insists that Alexian to be
sacrificed over his his funeral pyre so that she can become his bride
in the underworld. Election is not a woman. She's a girl. And this is
a parallel to how the whole Trojan War starts the turn of the Greeks
that sailed from Greece. They have trouble with the winds. And
Agamemnon eventually offers his daughter to be sacrificed so that the
winds will return. And at the end of the battle, at the end of the
war, when the Greeks set sail for home, Alexanian sacrificed to
become Achilleas bride and the underworld so that the Greeks can have
a safe travel home in the war. Here with human sacrifice, its grisly.
It's awkward in the song at a wedding. But the facing that and we'll
talk about why in a minute, and then we had this Eppalock, do you
remember what the epilogue is, what he said, what Catullus writes
about at the end? Is it metrological at all? So, you know, it's not
cartels is running on his own that he breaks the narrative, he jumps
forward in time a few thousand years up to his own day, and he writes
about how all of the things that he just said, all of this would
never happen today because of all the wickedness, all of the the
illegal activity, the immoral behavior that everyone in his own day
practices, all of that keeps the gods away. It taints humanity to
such a degree that the gods won't show their faces among people
anymore or even show themselves to the light of day. Does this sound
familiar? Where have we heard this before? Things are so awful today
that the gods intentionally keep their distance. Things were good
come that. And here we are today. Is it is it work some days, the
ages of man. It started off in the golden age, then the silver, then
the the bronze, the age of heroes and then the age of iron in which
you see lives where everything is is wrong, everything is broken, and
the gods keep themselves at a distance. This is not unique to
Catullus. Probably drawing on kizzie here for that. So this is the
basic story, it's not balanced. It does not proceed at an even pace.
We saw this with Hellenistic epic as well. It's a little bit uneven.
It's very kind of awkward the way he messed stories within other
stories. This is not something we see in Greek epic. This is Catullus
trying to be very polished, very poetic, very literary if there's
allusions. And again, that palimpsest idea. Right. What he's writing,
it's not actually what he's writing. It's writing about the and that
is talking about Ariadne's talking about Aleksa. But he's not
actually talking about that. So let's break it down, all of it. We
have the literary background, let's look at what we don't see on what
we do see and what those differences might be. Do we have
typesetters? It's not really. Closest we can possibly come would be
the catalog of allies, sort of when he's talking about the wedding
guests, that line to seventy eight. But that's not a very good
parallel, really, it's the closest you can come, there's no battle.
Even the battle with the Minetta is not really describe the minute
the battle is more than a sideline into an epic simile about a tree
falling on a mountaintop. There's a pun there to the tree falls in
the Tarus Mountains. Tarus is the Latin word for both tower. It's a
bad pun anyway. That's about all we get. So this off the bat marks a
little bit different. We haven't seen an epic so far without any type
signs in it at all. Catullus is trying to take one down. Do we see
formulas or epithets? They are not of the way that we see in old
Greek epic, certainly they're not even really what we see in light of
recovered. And this has to do not so much with Catullus turning away
from them intentionally. It has to do with the way that Latin
evolved. I think back to those old the old metrical form with a break
in the middle of the line, you just don't have space to include the
same kind of formula structure. You only have two or three words and
half a line of formulas don't really matter as much. So you don't
have the formulas, you don't have the complex epithets as much. The
focus is more on the story and on the emotion. We do have epic
similes again, the tree falling in the mountains, but the epic
symbols are not used to flavor the story anymore. They're not used
just as ornamentation. They are used to actually describe the action.
They used to actually progress the narrative of the story, which is a
new thing that Catullus does. We're going to see that more and Roman
epic and we have a lot of changing traditions. Now, this is something
that would not be apparent to you guys as you just as you read
through it. But if you're the audience with that background of
knowledge and you're reading this, you're going to pick up on some
things that are a little bit different. So, for example, when when
playing tennis fell in love during the voyage of the Aagot at the
very beginning of the epic, that's not how any tradition of the story
went before Catullus. We look at the beginning of the Nonaka when
Apollonius is talking about the the ship leaving, that is with
Achilleas as a baby in her arms, comes down to the shore to tell
Pelias goodbye. So this is a bit of a departure here he has that is
marrying for love, the word love appears a large number of times in
this. You want to count them up. And that's to emphasize that the
marriage is taking place because they're in love, not just because of
this fulfillment of a prophecy, which is how every other narrative
described it prior to this. We have folks only succeeding because of
Ariadne's help, much the same way as Jason only really succeeds in
anything he does Inculcates because Madea uses her magic to help him.
This is not the way Theseus has ever described. Prior to this,
Theseus as the the main hero of Athens has to always succeed because
he is the hero of Athens. He has to succeed by his own mind, his own
ingenuity, his own cleverness, his own heroism, and a big character
at best. Earlier retelling story, but can tell us that intentionally.
And then we have folks at the very end when the states begin to sing,
you notice they repeat a line frequently Spindel spin on and on,
enlarging the fabric after line and the line number after line, about
three twenty three. This is a chorus. This is a song broken into
stanzas, into verses. And this would be based on the sort of work
song that women would sing as their spending. The spending is not a
solitary activity as a community to get together and spend. If you've
ever spun a spindle, it's time consuming it after you do it a few
times. It's not really thought provoking either. So this is the time
when people would get together, when women would get together and
socialize. They tell stories, they teach their children. They talk
about what's going on in the world amongst themselves, and they would
sing songs, work songs to help pass the time. This is based on that.
But it's not your average casual work song. It's not something that's
educating children. It's something that's educating the gods
themselves about the fulfillment of this prophecy. And ultimately
about human sacrifice, which will come back to. Language performance.
What do you think, aurally composer written? Can we imagine someone
singing this? Not really. Catullus didn't write his poetry to be
sung. Well, that's not true. He wrote some of it to be sung. Some of
it was. Some of his poetry is a bit comedic or. Yeah, we'll just
leave it at comedic and was intended to be sung, but this was
probably not it was intended to be read. It's a very complicated
storyline. It doesn't have clear transitions. It's not really clear
to an audience what's happening at some points. And so if you're
hearing this and then the singer just moves on from there, you're
going to get lost pretty quickly, probably within the first 20 or 30
lines. This is something that you kind of have to read. You have to
have a text in front of you to reference. He says. This thing here is
that we flip back a couple of pages and figure out where we started
that story. Right. You need a text in front of you. It's that sort of
story. And remember, that Roman epic is intended to be referential
like that. When I say referential, I mean, it's intended to make
references constantly that the audience probably has some basic
knowledge of. But they might still have to flip back a couple pages
to figure out how exactly that's working. This is how Roman epic is
formed from the start, it's not oral, it's always written. So when we
see elements of oral poetry in it, like epithets, like formulas,
they're in there for different reasons. They're not because this is
what the poet is trying to do with the line, but they're primarily
because this is the form of poetry that the poet is trying to write
again. We do get an indication, but it's a little bit different. For
starters, it's not at the beginning of the poem, it's about 20 lines
in. And in this in this invocation, he's not asking for the God's
help to tell the tale at all, he's actually asking for the gods not
really asking anything. He's telling the gods that he's going to
invoke them. This is not really an invocation. It's more an
announcement that he's going to make an invocation that never really
counts. It's one of these elements that's supposed to be in an epic,
but it's just kind of a trump at this point. It's not a real prayer.
It's not a real introduction. It's not a legitimate plea to a divine
entity to come down and inspire the art of creation in the arts. It's
just a part of the poem. And if we look at the language, there's a
lot of nuance in the language. There are a lot of words with double
meanings in the Latin that help to actually explain some of what's
happening, especially with Ariadne's story. Let's look at that. When
we think about the hero. Is there a hero? Really? Are there a few
heroes curfew? Is there a primary one, not really. Seems to be just a
series of unconnected stories like. So the heroes that we have. We
can identify police there, sassiest as mentioned, ARIADNI Alexian,
that is not really a hero in the way that she's described. So for I
guess of these four, what are their qualities? What do we know about
about the idea of the hero from Catullus? Anger is a huge aspect,
right? These are not even tempered people. Calm, quiet, people don't
become heroes, is forgetful, so that a quality we've seen before.
Now, this is not one of those old heroic values you want a hero that
is mindful of everything that's happening around them. Always
remember this gets a little too cocky and sure of himself as the
Cyclops and is condemned to wander for nine years because of it. If
they're for if a hero is forgetful, if they don't pay attention to
what's happening around them, bad things happen. Deceases forget that
things do happen, but it's still a defining characteristic of who he
is. What about Achilles? Not that up. What about Achilles? But we
know about him. He's very brave. Never shows his back to the enemy.
He wants to be a hero. He chooses that life and then he regrets it in
the end. And we're given a reference to that. And the fact that he
appears in the story as a ghost. He has already died. He appears as a
ghost. He asked for the sacrifice. So he's dead. He's regretting that
choice. He's regretting the things that he did not get a chance to
accomplish or enjoy in life. And so now he is asking for those things
in death. This is not a normal thing. The fact that one of these
requests is a human sacrifice, which under any other circumstances,
outside of the tradition of the Iliad, is pretty. It's a pretty
serious sacrilege in Greek religion. This is not normal. So Catullus
is going to some lengths to emphasize that the heroic qualities of
the of these heroes, they're not actually good things. Right. And he
does that with the language, too. There's a line fifty one here.
Paddlewheel, Mirah, there are two things in Endecott there, that word
means Desplaines, that's how your translation takes it. The here it's
the. The embroidered blanket on the on the couch or bed is displaying
heroic virtues with wondrous art, but that word actually has a lot of
different meanings. One of those meanings is a legal term. Untrendy
if you're in a court of law and you introduce evidence to prove that
your opponent is guilty, you indicate that evidence. You are
indicting them. That's where we get the word you're indicating that
evidence to show guilt so that this embroidered blanket is showing
the guilt through its wondrous art of Theseus and general heroic
values is kind of interesting. It's a break again from what we would
expect to see again from David Constant Heroes. And we'll show a
callous indifference toward outsiders that accompanies a great
dedication or dedication to great deeds. This is often the Roman view
of a lot of these great heroes. The Greek mythology, the stories that
they tell, the narrative aspect of it is still very important.
They're basing a lot of a lot of literature on these older Greek
examples. But the morality that's associated with what the heroes do,
it's a little bit different in the Greek culture and in the Roman
culture. Some of those things are not as acceptable. Some of them are
downright abhorrent. And Catullus is pretty much calling them out for
that. And he calls them out in the case of this, through ARIADNI. So
when ARIADNI says no woman should place our trust in a masculine VAO
or think the speeches she hears from a man are sincere when the
spirit is yearning for something they longed to possess no oath as to
awesome a promise too costly to make, but quell the lust of their
questing minds at once. Their words are forgotten and perjuries
ceases to matter. This is Ariadne pointing out that all of these
values, all of these things that the old Greek epics, the old Greek
heroes had and displayed, they're not actually good things. They're
destructive. They're bad in social terms. They're bad for society. If
everyone acts this way, trying to pursue these, these are like
values. Society can't exist. There has to be something else going on,
too, this is not a great concept, the rich valued that that heroic
those qualities and that questing for heroism, the Romans, it's a
little bit different. So with that in mind, what do you think the
Roman society would value, what do you think Catullus readers would
value? What of Roman society do we see implied, at least if not
directly stated in this one? You can look at Ariadne's Curse Theseus.
When she curses this year, she calls him her husband. It's actually
the Latin word used. There are a few words that mean husband. She
uses the one that is unambiguous to mean husband. So in her mind, at
least, they are married at this point. And so since marriage is a
sacred vow, is protected by the gods, she doesn't call just
generically on the gods to avenge her. She calls on the furies, the
avenging spirit, to come down and pursue people who have broken
oaths, who have violated not just human law, but divine order. And
this is something, again, we probably would not see in a great
context, this represents. In a Roman society, a much different idea
of gender roles, a much different idea of how family structures
themselves were supposed to work. When we look at Odysseus, for
example, he stays for an entire year with CRC, that's not going to be
something that's appropriate in a Roman, but it's something the
Greeks could do because it doesn't actually threaten the integrity of
the boycott's that home of the household of a citizens. But to a
Roman audience that rings a little hollow. It's it is a threat. It's
a violation of trust and of divine order. So Ariadne's curse is based
on that. It's not just that Theseus leaves her, it's that he leaves
her after becoming your husband, after making this oath to her, even
violated. And then we have the epilogue. Come back to the narrator's
voice, do we have a narrator? Yes, we have an area made explicit a
couple of times we had the invocation verbs in the first person I
will invoke I think this I tell you about this, but it really only
comes out in the invocation and in the epilogue. And again, this is
not a narrator in the sense of someone who is sitting in front of you
singing the song. This is a narrator in a purely literary convention.
This is what someone expects epic poetry to be. So this is what it
is. But in the way that Roman literature functions, the narrator has
a point to make. There's a reason that could tell us is telling this,
and it has to do with that that idea that things were good, now
they're bad and everything can be good again, but not because of the
wickedness of of mortals. So if we look at when Catullus lit what was
happening at this time, when Catullus was born at about eighty four
BCE, he was born up here in northern Italy, which was actually
involved. He moved to Rome as an adult, started writing poetry. This
was a very complicated period in Roman history and could tell with
writing and when people were reading catalysis poetry and it was
becoming more popular after his exile and this was a period of three
civil wars, the Roman Empire existed like this during catalysis
lifetime. It had expanded to most of the places that the Roman Empire
would expand to ever still free after this, but not significantly.
And in. It dates right on this, about fifty four B.C., I think the.
Not forty nine points on the map and forty nine Caesar leaves legal
march is down to Rome. Pompey flees Rome, his political opponent
flees Rome, and this starts the civil war. Right. There's the civil
war between Caesar. Caesar ends up winning, going back to Rome. He's
declared dictator. And after a few years, he's assassinated.
Assassins flee to all the corners of the empire, trying to rally
support Caesar's adopted nephew, Octavia, who would become emperor
and one of Caesar's generals, Marcus Antonius. Marc Anthony, try to
avenge Caesar. They hunt down all of the assassins and systematically
kill them and root out their support. But then Octavia and Anthony
can't really figure out how to share the power that they now have. So
there's a third civil war. All of this happens in about 30 years time
line 30 less than major civil wars, all of it occurring based on the
politics in one city led by generals, all from that city, fought by
people from all over the empire, but with commanders and troops
primarily drawn from that one city. So if you're an upper class roon
and can tell us day, you know, a lot of people who have spent the
last 30 years leaving room to go out to all corners of the empire to
fight the Romans, not barbarians, not trying to expand the empire,
not doing anything that would bring glory to Rome, but fighting other
Romans. It's a tumultuous time. It's a time of instability. It's a
time of uncertainty. If you're living under the early reign of
Augustus as emperor, you don't know where this is going. We look back
on this now as one of these high points of Roman history in Roman
Roman culture. At the time, they did not see that way. They thought
it was a low point. They thought society was at its lowest, that it
could possibly be because they had no idea what was going to happen.
And there was this very pervasive idea that Roman society was in
decline, that things had been good earlier, but somehow society had
lost its way and things were in free fall now. And because of that
free fall, that's why the civil wars kept happening. That's why these
these leaders kept seizing power illegally, at least for Roman law.
And that that was going to continue unless the Romans could figure
out how to change their own society from the inside. And so that's
why we get quotes like this when we have Catullus at the very end.
Talk about the mad confusion of everything, right and wrong is driven
away the righteous minds of the gods, wherefore therefore they need
to attend such mortel assemblies nor let themselves be touched by the
light of day. Catullus is bemoaning the fact that everything that is
happening is lawful and terror. Things were once good, but now
they're terrible. What's interesting is that he is talking about the
same thing two hundred years earlier when he is talking about the
ancient customs that men on which the Roman state stands firm, what
he's talking about is those ancient customs that to him in the third
century were already ancient. On those customs, the realm of that day
stood firm, not in his day, it was riding again for a moralistic
purpose, moralizing purpose, trying to provide examples that Roman
citizens in his own day could walk up to and try to enact. Catullus
is doing the same Hesiod. What, four hundred years before innocence
in another culture in Italy is doing the same thing. There's this
idea that the earlier ages, the earlier generations always had
something better, had easier somehow, and that because of the moral
vices of the current generation, everything is now terrible. It's a
very common idea. We see it around us today, too. Right. And this is
one idea that Catullus says that every generation of Romans had had
for centuries before him, too. And it's going to be something that we
see a lot of. The reason that Virgil is writing The Aeneid has to do
with this sort of idea, the reason that Lukken and stations were
writing, what they what they did and what we're going to read later
has to do with this idea, too. And when we get to the late antique
epics that have to do whether it's talking about the Chronicle of
Dionysus coming out of India or whether it's talking about the birth
of Christ. These efforts have to do with ideas that are rooted in
this sort of thing. OK, so keep this in mind. We will definitely see
this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_bo9s6a9krg44"></a>Aeneid 4</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">They won't take offense. All right. So
we continue with Romanovich looking at Virgile and the and yet let me
start by asking how many of you have read at least a piece of the
Aeneid before so that, too, is covered in high school? If you are
not. All right, so what do you think of this book? If you have not
read it, any thoughts on it? Writings made me upset, just like how
much they prioritize you over that relationship with anyone else feel
like. This is kind of cool. What do you think? Yeah, in spite of the
fact that the word there are lots of words for a spouse will not lots
or several words for spouse and Latin. And the one that is
unambiguous for husband is the one that's used throughout this this
book. So, yeah, it's come across as political. And it's supposed to
actually, which is the interesting thing, that it was supposed to be
the sympathetic character not in this, which is kind of an
interesting inversion. I feel like there was something else I was
going to say, mark that down to the sinus infections, so I'm going to
skip the discussion for today because there are a lot of slides here
and I don't want to run out of time. So we'll jump right into Virgil
and Roman like spelling of Virgil. That's what I was going to
mention. I'm spelling it with the knee. You will see it with an eye.
I only bring this up because I got an email, two emails about it last
semester. They're both technically correct in English. The A's more
common in English. The E is more common in Latin. So let's go with
that. So Virgil was born was born into a Roman family before northern
Italy. But technically in Rome itself, much like Catullus, he grows
up in this environment, is highly educated and much like a Tulsans of
traveling through this education and ends up in Rome. I should point
out that we don't actually know a whole lot about Virgil's childhood.
It's sort of like Homer entered the world of math. And so there's all
these stories about Virgil moving around, doing things, basically
being apocryphal or not apocryphal, prophetic in his youth and later
traditions, even make him into a sorcerer or magician, which is kind
of weird. So we know a lot about him. He was highly educated and
whether he started writing epic poetry at the age of 14, as is
reported or not, he was already known in Rome before he ever got
there as a young man. So like at the age of 20 or something like
that, he gets to Rome. He already has a reputation as being a great
poet, and he comes to the attention of some powerful people there at
a time that is inopportune in Roman history. So we talked about last
time I talked about ended in a different way. We heard last time when
we talked about Catullus, about everything that was happening in Rome
at this time. So we have three civil wars from forty nine to thirty.
So a span of twenty years, about one generation. There are three
civil wars. The upper class of Roman society is quite literally
decimated by these wars. This is the officer corps of Roman society
and it's not wiped out, but it takes a pretty serious population that
values of what it means to be Roman are kind of shaken by this, these
experiences. And as I talked about last time, we have this idea that
Roman society was in free fall. So by the time I came to the Caesar's
adopted son and one of his former generals engineer fighting over
this empire, by the time that Octavian wins, no one knows what's
going to happen. I'll come back to that later. No one really knows
how this is going to work out, Octavia becomes the sole of the last
man standing who becomes the Emperor Augustus. No one at the time
knows that this is a good thing or not. We think of it as a time of
stability. No one at the time knew that it was not known. And it's
important to realize that while Octavian Augustus is going around
doing all of this, he has people back in Rome working to drum up
support for him in the war because even he doesn't know if his power
is going to last. Have three civil wars in 20 years. No one has
managed to hold on to power very long. So he has this guy named
Mightiness, who was one of his advisers in the city of Rome. My sense
is a very wealthy man, very cunning politician who goes around the
city making friends. He's very personable, very good at making
friends. And one of the things that he does is he drums up a lot of
support from artists, especially poets. He goes around finding poets
who can write really impressive things that support Octavia. And when
Virgil comes to the city, he already has this reputation of being a
poet. And so scene snaps him up and make sure that Virgil is
commissioned to write something in favor of Octavia. And this
ultimately becomes the path on which he writes the Aeneid. So Octavia
goes off, wins this war. We're going to work with something right
there. This is the big final battle. Anthony loses Octavia and wins.
And then he comes back to Rome. And on his return to Rome, Octavia is
greeted by my students. And this is young Virgil who reads a poem,
this very glowing kind of saccharine, sappy poem in favor of Octavia.
And it wins him support and instantly loves Virgil and commissioned
him to write The Aeneid. Because, again, no one knew what was going
to happen. We think of this as a period of stability, but no one knew
that Itanium wanted to have stability. Octavia. Now, the Emperor
Augustus wanted to have stability, but he didn't know exactly how to
do that. And so what he needed was a symbol, something that would
connect everyone in Rome, something that could connect anyone who had
taken a side against him and any of the civil wars, him or his family
in any of the previous civil wars, something that everyone could use
to assert their collective Roman ness. And so what he needed
effectively was a national epic, something that could work as a
founding document for the people, not just the city, but the people,
the Roman people themselves. And so that's what the Aeneid was
intended to be. So when we read The Aeneid, that's what we have to
think about. So all of this beauty, all of the faith, it's not just
in this. It's the Roman people that are bound up in that. Now, the
Aeneid, in terms of this this tradition, it's entirely within the
epic tradition of Roman epic, it's entirely political. He's drawing
on something we talked about last time, Puddicombe, which was
political. His name is writing about the the first Punic War, the
war, first war with Carthage. And in that epic, he is writing about
the history. But there's myth sort of as a subtext, right? Virgil
flips it. He's writing about the myth with the politics, the subtext,
maybe I should give you this term subtext to talk about the idea of a
palimpsest, this document that's been scraped mostly clean and then
written over. But you can see the old ideas underneath it, literally
underneath the new text. Well, that's the subtext. That's actually
where our words subtext comes from, is this idea of metaphorical
meaning the reading between the lines? It's that subtext in that
palimpsest. So Virgil grounds all of the politics as subtext behind
the mythology. So when he's drawing on the Iliad and The Odyssey and
everything else, he's really writing about Roman politics. And this
sounds perhaps kind of obvious to us that things can have this
double, meaning that at the time that he's writing, remember, there
was Catullus writing is one sixty four. And then there's this there's
not a whole lot else going on. With Greek mythology being used this
way, there's not really a major effort to take the old Greek myths
and make them into modern political statements. So when Virgil does
this, it's it stands out. It makes him known in his circles. And it's
worth pointing out that he took 10 years to write this thing and he
only stopped because he died in 19 B.C.. So he's the topic itself is
effectively unfinished, if not unfinished, in the sense that there
were more books going to come after this. That's not quite right. But
there were there are things that aren't quite as polished as they
could be. Remember that everything has a certain meter. Well, there
are some things, some lines where the meter just doesn't quite work.
There's like a syllable that needs to be added somewhere that's not
quite there. There are some metaphors that are just a little bit
rough. They don't quite read. Right. So he wasn't quite finished. He
was still tinkering around the edges because in that 10 years we
really wrote about two or three times a day. That's his pace for ten
years. It's a very slow pace. And the reason he took this slow pace
was because he was being very intentional about every single thing
that he wrote. There are poems that you read and you kind of think
that there's a meaning in there, but you're not really sure if that's
what the author was intending. Anything that you could possibly read
into what Virgil is writing is probably what he was intending, that
he's being very, very intentional with his word choice. He's
referencing lots of other works, literature. He's referencing his own
works. He's referencing the Aeneid itself in different lines. He's
trying to work in all of these different references, all of this
different subtext, often in support of Augustus, but often just to
show off his education and his learning and his talent. And it made
me see the other side, he was he was very careful in the way that he
was crafting it and he was so careful that he was trying to put so
much of himself into it that he left statements in his will that if
the epic was unfinished, everything was to be burned, nothing was to
be released. And it took Augustus himself to counter that that legal
well and distribute it. So that's why it's unfinished. He died in the
process and Augustus was very light editing, released it as it was
because it was such a glowing endorsement of his own life. And it was
very famous, very popular, very successful in endorsing Augustus.
Other poets at the time, like Repurchase here, wrote for Virgil the
power to tell the Shores Act Akiem. That battle where Augustus
defeated Anthony became the sole ruler to tell about Kinshasa's in
this guard. And Caesar's gallant ships do not waste to life the arms
of Troyes. Innocence and walls cast down on liberty and shores.
That's literally the city of Rome surrender. Writers of Rome
surrender Greeks something greater than Eliot is born. Virgin was
always very careful not to try to compete directly with Holmer, it
can never compete with that historical tradition. But what he could
do was try to rival it with something else, rival it with his own
tradition. And Latin Authors' at the time readily played into that.
They readily supported that. So this wasn't just a national epic in
support of Augustus, it was a national epic showing that the Romans
were now the inheritors of all of this tradition that had built up in
the Greek the Greek epic literary tradition. I'll point out that this
is written per person who wrote this long before the Aeneid was
actually published, so there was a lot of groundwork that was laid to
make this a national epic. It's not just that it was published and
everyone liked it. It's that a lot of groundwork was laid by Augustus
himself and by people working for him. And it's effectively
propaganda, this whole thing is a giant propaganda work supporting
Augustus. It's subtle in moments and it's really not subtle in other
moments when we read book sex for Thursday. It's not subtle at all.
And this goes to the underworld and meets or at least sees all of
these people who will become great romance in later times. And it's
does away with subtlety altogether. Everyone at the time, the Roman
audience at the time, was completely OK with the idea that it's
propaganda because they can find something of themselves in it,
whoever they were, whatever family they belong to, whatever side they
had been on during the civil wars, they can find something to relate
to, something that pointed to their families traditions or their
family's role in Rome's history. There was something for everybody in
it. And so in that sense, it was successful in being a national epic.
It's propaganda for Augustus, but everyone finds something of
themselves. That's what made it really, really successful and
popular. Any questions about that? Well, I consider. So when we look
at the structures. All right, we look at the structure of the Aeneid,
perhaps not surprisingly, since he wrote it at a pace of a couple of
lines a day for 10 years. There are a lot of different structures to
it. It's not like, well, the Odyssey or The Iliad or it's organized
into four book chunks. And you can you can read other structures into
it. But those four book chunks make the most sense and has a lot of
different structures, depending on how you want to see it. So there's
a bipartite structure in the two forms here where the first half of
the epic is modeled on the Odyssey. This is a Nancies analysis.
Odyssey is traveling around trying to find a new home. He's kicked
out of Kickout Detroit's Larfleeze Troy as it burns around him and he
tries to find a new home. Then there's the midline break and then the
second half is modeled on the Iliad. He has found a home and now he
has to fight for it. Or you can look at it as a tripartite structure
where it's divided into three groups of four books. So the first four
books here are about Dinham, the Carthaginian Queen and the it's kind
of the tragedy of love tragedy in a very literal sense, like a
dramatic sense. This is the destructive, catastrophic power that love
can have to destroy people and cities to quite literally change the
course of fate and destiny. So in that sense, it's very much modeled
on an ancient Greek tragedy. And in the middle, four bucks, you had
the destiny of Rome, this is where we are kind of hammered over the
head with what Anestis has to do in his future, what he is fated to
do by the gods themselves. And in those last four books is about
Turness, who is an Italian hero. Who is on the other side of the war
on lands in Italy finds his new home and it's Turness that he has to
fight against. And this is very much like the tragedy of love. This
is the tragedy of war. Turness is a sympathetic character, much like
Ditmas, and their destruction together emphasizes that tragedy. And
so the destiny of Rome is kind of ringed by these enemies think
recomposition. And we can see a lot of ring structures throughout all
of this, what happens in but far is paralleled in book five is
parallel, in book nine and so forth, lots of ring structures and
parallel structures throughout all of this. Virgile crafted it very
carefully. Again, is trying to reference all of these things, is
trying to make you draw these these connections and lines between
different books. So as we turn to the narrative, we have to keep all
of that in mind. So whether we want to see look for let's get ahead
of myself, whether we want to see before 9/11 tragedy or somewhere in
the middle of this odyssey kind of depends on how we want to see it
in isolation. I think it's much easier to see it as the tragedy of
love. So perhaps we can take it as that for these purposes. Just very
quickly to go through the narrative. Don't bother writing this down,
this is to keep myself in. The book opens in medius race as we've
seen before, like in The Odyssey, this time with an S and the Trojans
who are already fleeing Troy. So this is placed after the events of
the Iliad, long after the events of most of the epic cycle.
Announcing the Trojans are already fleeing, they're already in route
and we hear about Juno, this is the counterpart of who already hates
the Trojans for much the same reason that I hated the Greeks. This
idea of the judgment of Paris. We went through this story. Right? You
go through the judgment of parents, Mahara loses. That's the same
sort of motivation with Junon here, given an overlay of fate that the
Romans like. So John hates the Trojans. Carthage is one of her
favorite cities, however, so she wants to destroy any slate. She
doesn't want Carthage to be threatened by someone that she already
hates. So she contrives with one of the other gods to to to whip up a
storm that's going to almost kill them all. The Trojans are caught up
in the storm at sea, and it's only the intervention of Neptune, the
God of the ocean that comes this down and let's face it, play out. So
the fleet, the Trojans fleet puts it at Carthage for repairs. And
this is when we have a scene of goddesses coming up with a plan to
make things work out the way that they need to work out. So we have
Venus as an mother. This is a counterpart to Aphrodite. And she said
to give it to us to weaken Dido's resolve by the queen of Carthage.
Dido is a Carthaginian queen. So your map of the next, like in North
Africa, she has herself finished Phoenician from modern day Syria and
she is in Carthage to begin with because her brother Daddo is married
to the king of Tyre and Dido's brother killed her husband to assume
the kingship himself and to save her own life. She she fled the city
in some accounts. She killed her brother before fleeing, but she had
to flee. In any case, she took supporters with her to the North
African coast, Carthage, and made it, swore an oath to her gods that
she would never love again, she'd never marry again. Her husband, who
had been murdered, would be her only love. So this is the result that
Venus will weaken. Now, in Book two, we find out why any of this is
important and he lands in the palace and begins to tell about the
fall of Troy again, he picks up after the Iliad after that most of
the epic cycle so that Virgil is not competing directly with Homer or
Homer's tradition. So he recounts the destruction of Troy and the
loss of his wife, whose ghost tells them to flee to a place called
Hesperia, even in the Roman mind. They were never entirely clear on
where burial was somewhere to the south and west. How far south was
unclear, how far west was unclear. And Anissa's clearly doesn't know
because he tries to found three cities before he actually ends up in
Carthage. So he keeps finding a city. It doesn't work. He keeps
finding another city that doesn't work because every time he just
can't find Steria. But he's supposed to find this some mythical
Hesperia, because they're a kingdom and another royal life, wait for
him. So this is his destiny outlined by the ghost of his wife as Troy
burns down around them. I give you the illustration here inside. This
is from a painting at Pompeii just calling back to parity because
nothing is sacred. So here an artist is carrying his father and want
to leave the son by the. Well, because they're dogs. Literally, I
just like. So in book, three ass has told his story, this tells us
this tells us why he's in in Carthage and tells the queen why is in
Carthage, and he elaborates by talking about his other duties, like
LeDroit, they say out here to the coast where he drives around the
city, that for itself it doesn't work. So he settled down the Greek
pergament lanes and found the city paper that sailed up to the
Algerian coast. But somehow he meets other survivors of the Trojans
who have apparently want like. Never entirely clear why, and they
tried to find another city with Roatan, which also doesn't work well,
it's all of these times he's trying to fulfill this idea of fate and
destiny, trying to found this this Hesperia, and it just doesn't
work. It's in Illyria, and before that, he learns of this prophecy
that it's not just that he's going to. Found a city, it's not just
that he's founding a kingdom, it's that he will found an entire
nation of people. I do want to make a note on the use of the word
race in most of the translations that we're going to read, the Romans
refer to themselves as a race. That's the gain. Is the Latin word
here, not what we mean by race today. Rather different concepts, more
like people or nation in the Latin sense of the word. But this this
prophecy is that his descendants will be a nation that will conquer
the world. So this gives him purpose, gives him a goal that he can
work toward. Elizabeth. And this is where Carrillo's the odyssey,
somewhere around here in Sicily, he encounters terribleness and
manages to avoid Carrodus Odysseus. And it did not work. Well, this
is where most of it is. Well, the last of Odysseus to sleep and then
were destroyed. So as does one better than Odysseus, the encounter on
Sicily, they encounter Polyphemus. But instead of trying to do battle
with the monster, they run away. They have good sense. They do one
better than Odysseus is one thing. Yes, because they also end up
rescuing men and women and they also end up rescuing one of Odysseus
crewmen. What is your thought? Had been eaten but had not. And
Odysseus rushed to leave the island with the sheep that he stole. He
left a guy behind and rescued them. So in all of this, he's doing one
better. Right. Which is kind of a metaphor for Virgil doing one
better also. And as they rounded the tip of Sicily, they make it as
far as Erich's, and that's when his father dies. They stop, they
pause for a minute, and that's when a storm hits. But to come back to
the depths after this on Thursday, but that's when the storm hit and
it blows then, of course, the Carthage. And that's where you guys up.
Now, this particular book Look for here was really popular in the
Roman world at the end of it as a whole, was really popular book for
was it particularly popular and book sex was particularly popular and
book 12. We're not going to read 12, but we are going to read four
and six. So we see lots of representations of this book kind of
compressed into single scenes. So things like this from Pompeii,
where we see Dido, we see her standing next to a personification of
the goddess Africa, and then above them is an assault ship sailing
away. So we see lots of these these images, that sort of shorthand,
the whole book throughout Roman art. So. I'm out of breath in my
throat. So you guys, Doctor. Well, what do we see in the narrative?
What happens first? Where do we start? Where does he look for open?
You're going to make me talk oranger. All right, we see a scene of
two sisters, Dido has already met. She's already fallen head over
heels in love with them. She's in love with him because of a plan
that has already been a hold off on that she's in love with him for
reasons that she doesn't really understand, and she's made this oath
that she will never marry again. And yet, here's an this is
confusing. She has it. Know what she should do? She wants to to
explore her love. But she feels like if she do if she does that, she
will betray an oath. She'll betray her family and her people. Where
have we seen this before? Yeah, yeah, this is how Book three of the
Argonautica opens well, not opens the section that I gave you. That's
how it opens, right? This is an idea being in love with Jason, not
knowing why, not knowing what to do about it and being caught between
a romance that she doesn't understand or particularly want of and her
duty toward her family and her people. Dido is feeling the same way.
And just like Nadia going to her sister for guidance, Dido does the
same. And just like with with Nadia, what they don't understand is
that it's actually the goddesses who are who were behind this, just
as Herra and Aphrodite and Eros were behind them, falling in love
with Jason to the point that she could not refuse Jason's request.
Juno and Venus and Cupid are behind this one where Dido cannot refuse
her love. And so this is a plan that Juno is well, both goddesses
have their own motivations here. Venus wants her son to not die and
Juno wants her city to not be destroyed. So she thinks that by
combining the Trojans and the Carthaginians, her favorite city of
Carthage can be saved. As much as she hates the Trojans, she doesn't
want to lose her city. So this is their plan for unities. It almost
works. What happens after this? That what happens in that hunting
season starts storming out, and that was to do with the guys and then
she and her mom would end up in this cave and they said, this is like
our marriage or whatever. And I think that when you start spreading
rumors about their loyalty and their inability to rule the rumor with
a capital R, the goddess of the Roman mind, rumor spreads throughout
people, letting them know what has happened. And in some way, Dido
doesn't really care, but it necessarily does. This is one of the
things that he can't really do. And why can he not do this? Why can
he not give in to what he clearly wants to do? It's about
waterboarding and which got. And the sense Jupiter, so the Greek gods
and Roman gods are not exactly parallel to one another. There are
slight differences between them. But in this respect, Jupiter and
zoos are pretty similar or pretty equivalent. Jupiter is the the God
who upholds fate to uphold identical fates or separate deities.
Jupiter ensures that what the fates have decided comes to pass
because Jupiter is a god of of oats and making sure that things that
have been sworn are held. I'm sorry, I really thought it would be
great for them to. The crew that's complicated, she changes a little
bit, so Minerva for the Romans still has a role. It's a different
role, though. Are you thinking of Mithras? Yeah, I thought it was the
three of the most prominent Minerva was part of one of the major
groupings, the Triads. Pretty sure Minerva was part of either the top
of the line or one of the other major triads. So here is still very,
very important. Just other aspects of it. Yeah, yeah. The Romans
group, their gods together, like you said, in triads and their powers
would often overlap so that you could you could actually, depending
on which gods you wanted to combine, you could actually. Like, let's
say you want this thing to happen, but there's not a God that does
that you can combine these other gods to make to kind of overlap
together to make sure that this thing happens and lots of different
gods are pulled in from other cultures to create these overlapping
branches of religion. It's kind of an interesting but somewhat
confusing combination. I can talk more about that in another. Yeah, I
went on a 10. Dupatta got the votes right. Who is making sure that
this happens, or rather what what states have ordained has to come to
pass, and this is not what the states have ordained. So what does
Jupiter do? Mercury, but yeah, yeah, Jupiter is Mercury, and Jupiter
says something, no one can resist it. Everyone has to listen. So he
tells Mercury to go tell Linus that this is not what he's supposed to
be doing. Get out now. You have a faint. You're supposed to listen to
that. You're supposed to obey that. What this is, is a pun in Latin.
Roma and Roma spelled backwards is or is the Latin word for love. So
what has happened is that the pendulum has swung a little bit too far
and this was caught in the middle. On the one hand, this is
definitely room. On the other hand, is what he actually wants. And
love is veered off course. He's not focused on Roma anymore. He has
gone to its literal polar opposite of love and he needs to get back
on course. This is Mercury's message to him. That obviously does not
take this well, what does she do? He tries to keep it from her, but
she then she finds out rages throughout the city and he freaks out
with him. I guess after that, she tried to talk to your sister. I
don't have a bullet point for what happens with that, what comes of
that conversation, he tells CNN that there is nothing else to talk to
them and let them at least stay for a little bit and show what
happened, 30, something like he never gets to hear that. And that's
what she said. Yeah, yeah. We really want this to have a peaceful
resolution. Right. We we have read Cotulla sixty four. So we're
familiar with the idea of a spurned lover, which is sort of wakes up
alone and abandoned ARIADNI on the beach. She wakes up to see Theseus
ship sailing off and she calls down the Furies as as vengeance or to
avenge her. I don't doesn't quite do that. But in the absence of all
of the efforts that she makes to find a solution that can make all
everyone happy, she is refused at every possible turn. No compromises
made by anyone except her. She doesn't just call down the fury. She
becomes fury. She goes one step further then Catullus did with
Ariadne and she becomes a fury. We'll talk about her her vows after
that and the thing that tips it as an ass. Again, another omen sent
in a dream from Jupiter, telling him about his his duty, his
obligations to fate. And so he up and leaves in the middle of the
night. At this point, he's not sleeping in the city anymore. He's
actually afraid to go into the city. Valid reasons, and he is
sleeping down at the ships, and so when he receives the settlement
from Jupiter this final time, he immediately wakes up and they leave
in the middle of the night. And I don't wakes up and sees this much
in the way that we saw with. Sixty four wakes up alone and abandoned.
And what does she do? She different from all the time and she ends up
having to tell a story. I think that. And she curses the night, yeah.
So this is the language she uses when she's talking about him and
what she will her curse effectively. The language here is the
language that we see in prayers. So she is praying to the gods that
this will happen, but it's distorted. It's not exactly a prayer
formula. It's kind of mixed with a curse formula, like the things
that you would take a nail and scratch into a tablet and then throw
it on a well, like that kind of curse tablet. And then she sanctifies
all of this with her sacrifice so that none of it can ever be taken
back and a Roman audience is thinking of this hearing or reading this
description, and they're thinking of what happens in a sacrifice. You
you talk to the gods, you call them down to hear what you're saying.
You make the prayer and then you offer the sacrifice so that whatever
it is that you have just prayed for doesn't really have to come true.
But it's really, really a good chance that it's going to come true if
everything has happened the way it should. And all of this this
pattern here is that so the Roman audience knows that based on
everything that has happened, the language that she's using and her
own sacrifice here, that this is what's going to happen. We know that
things are not going to go easily for endings in some way. We're
going to hear more from the front. Yeah, we're going to come back to
that. Yeah, that's that's one of the history things that that Virgil
works in here. Now, there's a reason that Dido is queen of Carthage
and not some city in Sicily at that time. Well, that's the mythic
grounding that he is getting ahead of myself here. But right before
she she kills herself, she calls to one of the nurses that she calls
bark and bark embargo's from a little town outside of Carthage called
Barkett, which is also where Hannibal's family came from. So his full
name is Hannibal Barka and Hannibal from Barca. That's the ruling
dynasty that he is from in Carthage. So this is a mythological
etiology for why all of this happens, why these two great kingdoms
came into conflict. I'll come back to that. All right, so it's
relatively straightforward in terms of what's happening, the language
is very drawn out, it's very elaborate, but the plot is fairly
straightforward. And in terms of what is happening, there's actually
a whole lot that's happening right now. So it's more the way that
Virgil is telling stories that gets gets across his skill as a poet
and some of these other scenes here. So what about the narrator's
voice? Do we have much of a narrator? Now. But he is telling his
story is there not doing much? I'll give you that the narrator. Well,
the persona that Virgil creates is one that's just sort of along for
the ride. He is the mouthpiece for what has happened. There is a
formal invocation modeled on the old style Greek epics at the very,
very beginning. And then he, as the narrator, is a sort of along for
the ride, whatever the gods and users choose to choose to sing about,
that's what he's going to say. We have him asking questions.
Something happens and then he will say how many people died because
of this decision, as if he doesn't know he's the one telling the
story, but he doesn't really know where it's going to go in this
respect. It's very similar to the narrators of the old Greek epics.
And yet he has these moments of being kind of. Omnipresent, you can
marry the innermost thoughts of people. So when Mercury appears to
ass the first time he tells an audience what Jupiter wants of them,
they're in line three, 12 and following and its wonders. He doesn't
turn to someone else and talk it out the way we've seen in other
older Greek epics. He goes off by himself and he ponders inside his
own head what he should do. And yet Virgil tells us all about his
thought process. This is something that a Greek narrator in the older
traditions would not have done and would not have had that even in
Connecticut, when Midia is wondering what she's going to do. She's
not sitting there quietly on her bed. She's wandering around her
room, speaking out loud to herself, as we would see in a play. That
model is what Ertl drawing on, but he doesn't have his characters
talk when they think they just think quietly to themselves. And he is
telling us all about this. So he's there, but he's along for the ride
for most of it, until he needs to be the narrator telling us what's
happening because we can't tell otherwise. So he's crafting this
persona, sort of that is at times in the older style and at other
times it's very much in a newer style, like we would see in a
Hellenistic epic, but amped up to a different degree. Does that make
sense? I feel like I didn't explain that well or good. Language and
performance. This is something that I don't know if anyone picked up
on. We don't really think about this in English, but in Latin, a
Roman audience would have would have picked up on this. It's
something called the historical present. That is the words
themselves, the verbs that are used to describe what's happening are
all in the present tense, even though they're describing something
that happened in the mythological past. This is not something that is
done in The Odyssey or the Iliad or any of the Greek epics. This
isn't even something that's done in Latin epic up to this point. This
is something that's done in history. Right. So when Lydie, for
example, wrote one hundred and forty two books of Roman history up to
his present day, all of it is in the present tense, as if he is at
that same time in the room with the people who are making these
decisions. And he's describing what he sees. That's the present tense
set in the past, present. And yet that's what Virgil uses here. So
he's taking those the convention of history writing and bringing it
into an epic setting. It's very subtle. It's not something that
really is easy for an English audience to pick up on because we're
reading in a translation anyway. But a Latin audience would have
noticed this. This is a breach of. Etiquette, I guess, literary
etiquette, and it's Virgile putting his own stamp on it. And then we
kind of have formulas, but not quite. There are formulas that for
some reason don't make it into the English translation or not for
their patronymic that don't really make it into the English
translation. I'm not really sure why select Saturnian Jupiter, the
son of Saturn, Jupiter referred to as Saturnian or Saturnian Jupiter.
That's in the Latin. Like. When it's on the effects of liking on
which some development on the label, they're not going to notice the
sun, but they're not used as formulas to fill out the line metrically
in the way that we see in Greek. Yeah, even that might have been part
of the college. I think it's style because what he's doing is he's
working within the conventions of EPIC. So we have these patronymic
that are used to refer to people, even though that's not what was
used in Roman society to label people that way normally. So this is
something that should be in an epic, but he doesn't really have to
use it because he's not trying to remember half a line at a time. So
the formulas have remnants in there, but they're not being used in
the same way. So they're just slowly dropping out. We kind of saw
this in Hellenistic literature, too. We have the formulas. We have
the epic similes, but they're used differently in different ways to
the point that slowly over time, they're just not there at all. They
just drop out. This group of lions here, line 16 to 16, where that
last night is described as very peaceful. We hear about the sounds,
we hear about the sights, we hear. I don't think smells are there,
but sights and sounds of a calm, peaceful night, this is something
that sounds very Homeric. If you look at those six lines there, it
could be straight out of Homer. It's not, but it could be. But it's
told in a formulaic kind of way with language that sounds as if it
could be Homeric, even though it's not really made up of formulas. So
he's taking these ideas and these sounds and these these patterns,
but he's using them in a way that he needs to to put the whole thing
together, not in a way that's actually made up of formulas that make
sense. So you're taking these ideas because he feels like they should
be there, but he's not using them in real life because he doesn't
have to. Because what he's more focused on is his own style of
telling the story. It's very broken, it's very staccato, very
impressionistic, and it's not the kind of reads that way in the
English. And it's not just the English. The Latin, too, is very
broken. It's very impressionistic. Help talk about the way something
looks or smells or sounds. And then in the next sentence, it's
something completely different. He doesn't always lead from one
sentence in the next to create this nice, smooth narrative the way
that Homer might. He's just going for really vivid descriptions of
individual scenes. And he kind of pops sometimes from seeing the
scene. And this can be really cinematic sometimes. So when he talks
about this, the storm of the hunt, it's overtaken by the storm and
then everyone has to flee and an assassin to flee to the cave. Well,
before that, he's not just talking about the hunt and the people and
the storm. He gives this sort of establishing shot that tells us
about the scene, talks about the mountains. He talks about the colors
and talks about the animals that live in the mountain but aren't
actively being hunted. He focuses on that to give us an impression of
what's happening, even though we don't actually have the details of
what the people are doing. What is this Fania's hunting? Does he
catch anything? Does anyone hunt anything? We have no idea. So I
actually said they're on a hunt, that's all he needs to say. The
mountains are described. The scene is describe the cave is described.
The storm is described. The people are described. What they're doing
is not important to the story. So he just kind of leaves that out.
He's going for these very vivid descriptions of short little things.
And we see that also in books. So when an artist goes to the
underworld, which is what book sex is about, we're going to get that
sort of impressionistic storytelling there, too. It's not quite the
same underworld that Odysseus visited. The literary background is
something, again, that he really tries to bring in every chance he
can. So we have epic smilies. Used like they were in the old Greek
epics. He's not trying to show off his learning and knowledge and
education, he's not trying to pull in these random variant
mythologies the way that the Hellenistic points were. We're pulling
in these these epic symbols. Four is using them for added imagery,
using them for effect the way that the old great poets were. But
they're not formulaic anymore. They're not these large blocks of text
that can be copied and pasted as they need to be. It's something a
little bit different. We have type things, but again, used in
slightly different ways, so we have the animal hunt, even though
animals are not actually apparently ever hunted by anyone. Certainly
no one is killed or none are killed. We don't have any of the animals
combat that usually defines this kind of type. We had this prayer and
sacrifice that title offers at the very end there, but it's
different. I'll come back to this. It's not really a proper prayer.
It's kind of verges into the magical side of things. And a lot of
this comes about because it's playing like Catullus did, like the
Hellenistic folks, that he's playing on the themes from drama,
especially tragedies. So generally everything is kind of dramatic.
But he openly refers to the scenes that he is describing as a stage.
The characters that he's describing as actors sometimes. And then we
have the surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of Dita. Finance is kind
of the bad guy in a lot of this, and that's very intentional because
when we look at Greek epic Greek drama, Greek tragedy, even when
they're describing the whoever is writing back, that when we look at
Greek tragedies, even when the tragedy is about an enemy of Greece,
it always paints them as a sympathetic group of people or a
sympathetic character. So we have tragedies about the Persians during
the Persian wars where Xerxes is not the bad guy. He's the victim of
bad advice. He is a tragic figure, even though he's the enemy of the
Greeks. We have the Trojans who are the subjects of other tragedies,
and the Trojans are not existential enemies of the Greeks. They are a
defeated and broken people who are worth sympathizing with. They have
suffered. And it's that suffering that makes it a tragedy. We are
supposed to empathize with them. And so Virgil's drawing on that
background to make Dido very sympathetic. And this has to kind of be
the bad guy here in order to make this a tragedy. Doesn't help us
empathize with his character, but it makes sense for everything else
that follows. Continuing delivery background clinic idea, I talked
about this before, remember the idea, what was called McKesson's
idea? Yeah. This is his long poem that made a name for himself before
he ever wrote it, where he's just writing a poem about etiologies,
writing a poem about origin stories, and this burst of rumor that
Virgil works in here when rumor flees out of the cave or runs out of
the cave to spread news of what has happened to people. We did this
little bit here, one one ninety eight about the birth of rumor. And
this is completely untested in all of literature prior to Columbus,
Columbus recording this or making it up. And this is where Virgil has
drawn that. We have other topics that we've seen and read before, we
talked about the sister relationship, one sister in an ill fated
romance and the other providing help doesn't actually help or come to
anything right out of the Argonautica, Nautica, Juno and Venus
conspiring to keep it as parallel between Aphrodite conspiring us. So
we can imagine that as Virgin is writing this, she has a copy of the
ARC, Atika, next to him on the table, and he's not copying the text
straight over, but he's very much drawing on those ideas and basing
his story on that. And then to tell a sixty four, I mentioned that
Catullus was the poem that he wrote, his many epic was very popular,
very well received at the time. Among his his readers was Virgile. So
the way that Dido awakes to find a new sailing away is the same way
that Ariadne wakes to find this is a ship sailing. But again, Ariadne
wakes. She's Angad. She calls down the Furies to avenge her because
of this betrayal. Dido doesn't do that. She becomes a fury she will
haunt. And as any anywhere he goes after this until his dying day,
she will be his personal poltergeist. That's what she's saying in her
fury. I see people still read. Now, there's another aspect of this
because of the way that he's writing the story, we know that he was
influenced by history, writing the historical present, but also he's
couching all of this is a mythology, but it's a mythology of Rome's
past. So he's drawing very directly on history and not just of
Romans. So, Dido, in this whole story of how she ended up in
Carthage, this has actually drawn from Phoenician histories,
Phoenician mythology and and. Similar historical, similar ethical
methow, historical accounts of their of their. Path out of Tyre. So
Daniel accounts to a figure that we know from Phoenician history as
Elissa, her husband, Zacchaeus, is either a Carrabba's or Scarabus
depends on the source. And then Dido's brother is in Latin that is
known as Pygmalion. Which comes from the. Lisa Bloom, who is the king
of Tyre after her, so these are all historical figures taken and
given different names that sound a bit easier to work into a Latin
poetry form and made into a form that allows the Roman audience to
know that he's not just making this stuff up. What he says is
actually the fate not just of an ass, but of everyone else in the
Mediterranean. Everything has this idea built into it because he
needs to fully integrate the story that he's telling into not just
Roman history, but the history that anyone else might know if he is
writing a true national epic or the Roman people he has to understand
and does that Rome is not just made up of people born in Rome like
him, born in northern Italy. Other people have different backgrounds,
different histories and different ethnic traditions. So he has to
cater to as many of those as possible. And that's why he bothers to
give Dido this back story. It makes her believable by plugging her
into a history that other people would already have known. And so
when he gets around to writing about the Roman history, what he what
we see and look for here is the expected history of that conflict
between Rome and Carthage. So Rome and Carthage were famous enemies.
They went to war three times. Carthage always lost each of those
three wars. At the end of the third war, supposedly, Carthage was
destroyed in its field, sown with salt to make sure nothing would
grow in America. And that's the story. The reality is that the Romans
just put a new colony right on top of it, renamed the town. But this
is a famous conflict that shaped Rome's destiny. It was the defeat of
Carthage during the battle, during these three wars that allowed Rome
to become the superpower in the western Mediterranean than it was by
Virgil's own day. And so we see traces of this in the language. So
when Aeneas goes to Carthage, he's received favorably. Initially, at
least, he is received by Dido as his host. And yet when Jupiter talks
to or sends the message through Mercury, he calls the Carthaginians
enemies. He calls them the hostile people. That's not how it is at
that moment in the story. But this is how the Roman audience would
have understood the Carthaginians to be. They would have understood
them to be traditional enemies of Rome curse. There is effectively an
aetiology for all of this, this conflict. This is very complex
political and economic history that Rome and Carthage shared that led
them to conflict multiple times is all given a nice, tidy, very easy
aetiology with this ill fated romance between the founder of Rome and
the founder of Carthage. It's very clean. It's very easy. It's very
neat and tidy for anyone to remember. And it's a whole lot simpler
than the actual geopolitics of life. And so this is why it was it was
convenient. It was convenient to tie in all of these different things
because it's what the audience already expected. And talk about this,
the nurse that Dido talks to at the very end there is the from the
same town as Hannibal's family. And yes, but I never know who's had
what classes or what that. Now, in terms of social backgrounds, like
many of the epics that we're reading at this point of time, there's
not a lot to say. Most of what we see at the very end, there is most
of the society that that we can really draw out of, this is at the
very end when Dido is making her curse, it's religious. So the
religious rights that Dido. Takes the steps that she takes in this,
the sacrifice of herself. They're very symbolic sort of manipulations
of what Romans would have done, a Roman audience would have
understood their own rituals to be so. Dido offers a sacrifice and
inspects the entrails of that sacrifice. What this is, is Harry
Spacy. There's a there's a, well, Roman sacrifice. It's very
complicated. The actual sacrifice that is the killing of the animal
or the offering of the whatever object it is you're sacrificing.
That's a very small part. What precedes that is marking out the
sacrificial sacred space. Then a priest reads a prayer in a very
specific way, not just speaking from the heart like Dido does, but,
well, sometimes I would actually have a text in front of them that
they read because the prayer is very important. You have to call the
God down in exactly the right way to make sure that they're not
angered. Then you have to sacrifice the animal in exactly the right
way. And the way that you know that you've done it all right is
because he respects this is the formal priestly position. After the
animal is dead, will will remove the animal's entrails and inspect
them and make sure that everything is OK. Look at the liver to make
sure that it's the right color. If it's too dark or too pale, then
there was something wrong with the animal. If the animal has a lot of
parasites in its intestines, something was wrong with it. These
blemishes, these imperfections would be seen as a sign that the gods
had not accepted the sacrifice. So when Dido inspects the entrails
like a Roman respects what she understands, that this is the will of
the gods. Nothing that has happened is her own fault. She has been
caught up in a battle that is larger than her and that she can't
really understand. This is the sign of that. She's using these Roman
tools as a Carthaginian because this is what her Roman audience
understands. But this is the ultimate goal here. We're sorry, the
ultimate point. And then her final prayers and sacrifices, everybody
said they're kind of like prayers. They're kind of that formula, but
not quite at the same time. She appeals to gods of the underworld in
that that final scene. You don't appeal to gods of the underworld if
you want something good to happen. This is what you carve on a lead
tablet that you're trying to use to curse someone you don't bring you
don't use these kinds of words and formulas and prayer if you want
good things to happen. You only use them when you want bad things to
happen. So all of these scenes, it's sorry, all of these prayers,
it's it's magical, it's twisted, it's not the normal thing. And this
is how we know as an audience that bad things are going to happen
because of it. That's about it. Not a whole lot of other social
conventions here because Virgil's focused throughout and a lot of
what we're going to see from here on out in Roman epics, it's very
personal. The Roman authors are very keen on developing characters
and developing plot lines. They're not as keen on world building as
the Greeks were. So the focus is very different there. What about a
hero? Obviously, NASA is a hero. We could perhaps say the same for
GUYTO in different ways. What do we what do we think heroic qualities
might be here? Our heroes described. It's been prioritizing his duty
over what? First, the. Also, not because they got. Yeah, very pious,
very keen on what the gods tell him to do, even to a fault, perhaps.
Anything else? Any heroic qualities for Dito? I mean. It wasn't bad,
but at the same time, anything you can say about her is almost
contradictory to say, because like I said before, they are very much
mirror opposites in the way that they're their characters and
developed their any any qualities of perhaps illness that are
surprising. Since he is the hero, are there any qualities we might
expect him to have that he doesn't have? It's kind of like this where
there was a wedding, but it does feel like it does feel like you
almost disrespects the family values as it goes towards the north,
which is now. Yeah, I think we're supposed to also think back to
Jason there. Not so much in the Argonautica, but in everything Jason
does after that. The multiple times he's one of the two times he
leaves Madea and then ultimately dies alone under it, under his chin.
I told you that story and he threw out everything. He's he's
incredibly human and very fallible. And he's not the strong pillar of
society that we see in the older Greek epics that that Virgil is
drawing on for support. He's very pious. He's very motivated. He's
very willing to subvert his own wishes. But he's not very not always
very strong in that result is more. And stuff like that. I think it
reflects the fallowed, the fallacies of people at the time, if that's
what you're asking. I don't know the politics plays into that,
though, but I don't think a Roman audience would believe in Jesus as
a strong, single minded character. It just wouldn't be believable. It
wouldn't be a man of the times where the three civil wars have
destroyed society. So he has to be very Roman in that sense. He has
to be prone to to fail and he has to be weak in his resolve and
reminded of his fate multiple times throughout the first half of the
epic in order to make him believable so that he is a subject of
faith. He's not the person making his own fate. He is a subject of
it, like every Roman at the time. And that fate, again, is to place
Roman above amore. It's not just an ass that had to do that, it's
every Roman at the time, those civil wars that everyone in this
audience originally would have lived through, they tore families
apart. It's not like one senatorial family went this way and another
family went this way. It's members of the individual family
scattering amongst the different factions for support. So placing
Rome under Augustus, above the old loyalties from before the civil
war period, that was really important for Augustus. That was
something he needed everyone in that audience to do. They had to put
Rome first. It just happened to be his Rome that their first.
Essentially, finances is the kind of hero that we talked about last
time. Remember this this quote, but by a constant traditional hero
show a callous indifference toward outsiders that accompanies a
dedication to great deeds. This is he doesn't come off well in most
of this and even through the very end of the epic, the very last
thing that NASA does is he kills the man on his knees who is trying
to surrender. It's not the greatest portrayal. And even a Roman
audience, they marvel at what what Virgil has done. But even at the
time, there are criticisms of business as a character. There is some
discomfort with what an artist does, even though everything he does
is effectively character growth, learning how to put himself while
learning how to subject himself to fate, learning how to subject
himself to a greater cause, in this case, fate. And that idea of
faith is what drives the whole ethic, because, again, going back to
what's happening at this time, faith in chaotic and uncertain times
can be comforting the idea that there's a reason that everything that
has happened, all of the bloodshed, all of the personal loss that has
happened in every single family in Rome up to this point because of
the last 20 years, there's comfort in knowing that it was all for a
reason. The idea that, again, it's not just about Augustus coming to
power, it's about everyone who has ever lived in the city of Rome
having a role to play. This is the fate of the Roman people, not just
Augustus's family. That narrative had a lot of a lot of support. It
was very well received. And it's one of the things that made the
Indians so popular in its day. The idea was actually talked about
this. So this idea of duty and fate and placing Rome above the self,
we're going to come back to this. We're going to come back again on
Thursday. But when we look at how Roman history is perceived outside
of Epic's, we're going to read something by L&eacute;vy. Wanted to
have you guys read. Oh, Horatius defending the bridge against the
invading Etruscans, this idea of subjugating yourself to the idea of
a greater good. This runs throughout Roman history. It's something
that Roman audience would have expected and really eaten up. So
remember this for when you go to book six, That Journey to the
Underworld. It's based on these ideas, this idea of fate as something
that is comforting, something that is inclusive for everyone in
modern society. And I want to end real quick by pointing out that
this is it is an aetiology for modern modern in his room. But Virgil
didn't just make this up. These are all pre-existing ideas. This idea
that Venus was the mother of Venus, whose son has two names in the
epic. The other name as in Julius Caesar. Right. This is the founder
of. It's more complicated than I made it here, but the founder of the
Roman people, the founder of the founders of Rome, among which is the
Julian family, so the Julian family, like Julius Caesar, trace their
lineage back to was from and it's all about convenience. And Octavian
or Augustus as being adopted into this family, could do the same. But
Augustus isn't making this up. Virgil isn't making this up. And I
give you a coin here that was mentioned by Julius Caesar writing his
name on it and on the reverse is holding his father and not leading
his son by the hand. He's holding the Palladium, Palladium. This is
the thing without which the Trojan people could not fall. Right. So
as long as they hold. As long as they hold on to the Palladium, there
will be people there will be a Roman people by extension and the
front of the coin above there is Venus identifiable by her, her
diatom and the wrinkles on her neck. This is the thing that the
status of attributes this is a coin that Julius Caesar meant it to
show his dissent from Venus and show that these these virtues of fate
and piety are built into his family all the way back to the very
beginning. But everything is destroyed. Sorry, which try doing it
again and again, you might think that you are wrong with that. Oh
yeah, that is from one of the last epics. So Aeneas himself is not
made up by Virgil. Those those epics that covered the fall of to
Paris's analysis in their analysis has a scene and the kippie in the
beginning, too. So he's there. And even the Greeks acknowledged that
he that he left. And as far as we can tell, earlier Roman
generations, far before Julius Caesar understood that ultimately they
came from the Trojans. There's this idea that the Etruscans
themselves, who live just to the north of Rome, may have come
originally from somewhere in the Greek sphere of the world that spoke
a language that's more closely related to languages in that area than
anything around Italy. So there's this long tradition of people
coming out of out of the Greek sphere into somewhere in central
Italy. And all Virgile really has to do is take this folklore and
polish it up and make it into epic. So this may be one way or the
other or the one way this works. So you list as your list goes on to
found some of his sons. I'm thinking this. That gets complicated. All
right. So, Anestis. Now, there are other traditions around. And it
gets complicated fast in one tradition, and he has a wife who ends up
becoming the children, children, children, children of brothers, ends
up being the kings of Alba Longa, which is a different city. In other
traditions, US becomes the founder of a family line that ends up with
the kings of the longa. So how do you construct this? The kings of
all the to come out of nest and then all the longa is the king of all
the longa has a daughter who is the mother of all those of us. So
that's how that comes about. And then there's another tradition in
their belief that the works with. Ask any questions. So remember all
this, because this is another rare moment of continuity when we're
going to keep repeating it for another day into Buxton's.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_a5b6w6a0qsmi"></a>Aeneid 6</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">OK, so we're continuing with the union,
looking at both if the need for looks at why Aeneas was on his
journey, what the point was and what is the point, why was he on
strike? If you could sum up look in one word room, it's going for
fate, but real, right? This is his destiny. This is what he is
gearing up for, Rome. But the gods have decreed that this is what he
is supposed to do. Rather, the fates have decreed that this is what
he is supposed to do. So that's all we look for is building toward
that end. Book six kind of fills out that picture. It doesn't just
build toward a general idea of Rome or fate or destiny. It lays it
all out pretty, pretty overtly. So let's look at what that is, how
that works out. He had six is often compared to Oddisee, 11 for good
reason. Eleven is Rhodesia's goes to the underworld and six areas
where it. So there are some similarities here, obviously, but there
are a lot of differences here. After all, the Aeneid is coming from a
completely different cultural context. We like to think of the Greek
and Roman worlds as pretty similar or not. I mean, they are, but the
similarities are often very superficial. They are different cultures.
So what do you see as well as the main theme of any sex? But how did
that main thing that is played compare with what we see in The
Odyssey? And what does it tell you about how the two epics differ
over all so focused on those differences? And think about what those
differences tell us about what is Roman here? Let's break up. Spend
about five minutes. We'll come back. U.S. officials insist that. And
that's just the only thing we know for sure, that this is what I look
back on, what I was getting told, what's going on in particular when
I was everyone in the same way. This is the kind of thing that
happens because I think it was the honesty for somebody else. But I
do think that there is something that we like to think that we going
to have an Islamic state. So it's not like we're doing something
wrong. It's comforting. It's like I mean, it's crazy to get on with
and of all of the war in Afghanistan. And it wouldn't surprise me if
this is so easy for me to go and see that. Before I got here, would
you guys come up with IDEA? Let's start with Main. What do we see in
any six? Obviously. But does that mean really? What do we see being
elaborated here? Look, six. Uzbek. The fate of these don't want to
create Rome and then Rome itself to become this great power. That's
the thing, yeah. The faith that builds to Virgil's day and the
Emperor Augustus by extension. OK, so what do we see that's different
about this in the Odyssey? Both our descent into the underworld.
What's different? This one for sure. Yeah, so everyone that Odysseus
met in the underworld was already dead, including people that he
knew, people that he didn't know had died, but everyone had already
lived their life before. Virgil manages to work in this interesting
way of seeing the future by looking at the people who have already
died. It's kind of an interesting way that he does that, but it
allows them to look at the future in a way that Odysseus never did.
Think that's all it was going for, like there was something else,
they're still not firing on all cylinders here. Anyone think of
anything else? Seeing them there was kind of like to be able to see
some people that had already died, but they gave like a similar feel,
the Virgile still very much in the. He's going for impression's
emotional responses on the part of the audience. And so he does try
to pull its some heartstrings there by bringing Dido back in that
weirdly hot in here to anyone else who does windows actually open or
did they remove the handles? Oh, awesome. Someone want a peek under
that and see if it opens? It's rising like a full degree and a half
science class started. Awesome. All right. So, yeah, with the future
in mind, that's really what what he's going for here. Remember that
there are lots of different ways to look at the structure of the
unit. One of them is in these smaller chunks that look at tragedies
of fate and bark and those new bracket, this idea of destiny and
Roman destiny, Roman fate. And that's really where Book six is coming
in. So let's we read book four last time. This is the five year to
bridge the gap here. Remember there they left all of this behind
them, trying to find their way through the prophecy. They ended up
getting blown up, of course, to Carthage. That's where they picked
that up and that's where they go. So then book tour ends with the
fleet sailing off by the fleet, sails back to Sicily. They arrive in
Eriks exactly where they started one year after the death of an SS
father encases. Now, this is kind of important because it's one of
the very few times in anywhere in the Enayat that we get any any
indication of the passage of time. There's really no clear scale of
time here. But this one year anniversary of his death is important
here because it allows NASA and its crew to commemorate that death
with funeral dates. And these are funeral games and the great
tradition, not so much following the Roman tradition. It emphasizes
that they are not fully Roman yet. There are things that have to
happen before they become fully rock. Latin audience, Roman audience
reading this in the Latin, we picked up on that subtle cultural
difference, just by the way that the games are described for encases.
Now, while they're there on Sicily, Juno. Remember, it is not once
the Trojans to escape. She had hoped that naans would marry Dido and
stay there so that the Trojans and the president of the United, some
of her favorite city, would not be destroyed. Now that that plan fell
through, she's back to wanting to destroy the Trojans. So she
inspires the Trojan women to burn their ships so that unaskable
stranded there on Sicily and can't go any further. Jupiter puts out
the fire because he is a god of storms also, and ultimately the fleet
set sail for Italy and a condition of the fleet. Safe passage from
Sicily to the coast. Here is that Neptune out of the sea will allow
them safe passage. No more storms, no more tricks. But he needs a
human sacrifice, like human sacrifice is a thing. And really, really
old Roman culture is the origin of gladiatorial contests. It's
ultimately a human sacrifice to the gods in the name of a wealthy
nobleman in this kind of reflects that idea. Yeah. Very briefly, I
think, in making some sacrifice here. That did happen tonight, and
the first one think that I just remember reading somewhere that they
very briefly brought it back just because they were so desperate,
they went back to basically saying, oh, this is terrible. Yeah, I
think you're right, I can't remember the story, but that does ring a
bell. Yeah. That's going to bother me. Yeah, so this is an aspect of
old Roman culture, it emphasizes the antiquity here and it would have
run as kind of faded and antiquated audience, but it's entirely
within the cultural understanding. And so Neptune's demand for a
human sacrifice is fulfilled with Norris, who is the helmsman for one
of the ship's ships, didn't have Rutter's. At this point in time,
it's a big or that sticks off the back of the ship and someone has to
sit in the back of the ship and hold on to it so that the ship stays
on course. While he's doing this, he falls overboard and droughts.
And that's the sacrifice for capture, which allows the fleet to sail
not just for anywhere in a very specific place, but to my mind for
the Romans, is laden with symbolism. We'll come back to that in a
second. But let's look at the structure. So this sets us up for book
six. So depending on which sort of construction we want to take, your
book six is either very end of the first half. It's either this or
this hinge point that leads into the second second half of the epic.
But it's underscoring everything that has happened so far,
underscoring the point of this odyssey from the point of why he's
traveling or tripartite structure. It's right here in the middle
underscoring what it is exactly that the destiny of Rome is to
everyone. We want to take the overall structure of the epic
influences, how we should understand book sex. Now, since we kind of
work with this structure in the last class, I'm going to keep with
that because the destiny of Rome is really not subtle in book sex.
It's should be really obvious, even if you don't know who the people
are, even if you don't really catch all of the mythology and the
social and historical references in the book, it's really obvious
that he's building to this idea of destiny. And let's look at the
narrative itself. All right, so he sails the Cooma humayun's, the
historic. Home of the command civil. That rain. Neat. I don't make
the 15 minute walk I have to make after the sausage. All right. And
for many of you, too. All right. So come is the historic home of the
command. Sybil Sybil is an oracle. The oracle of Delphi is a symbol.
And so this is a oracle that the Romans used to come back to that
Martha. So they sail there and we have this very brief description of
the temple of Apollo and then he talks to the soul. And what does
this tell? Perhaps I should pause here to mention what it is a simple
to cibils, talk to the gods civil. There are lots of different
symbols, lots of different oracles throughout the ancient world and
lots of different cultures, but they all talk to the gods or a
specific gods. In this case, the God Apollo. And when they speak to
people because they go into a trance, what they're speaking is
essentially gibberish. They speak the language of the gods directly,
face to face with the gods. But then we normal people can't really
understand that language. So they speak gibberish and that that
language of the gods has to be translated by someone else. Is that
what happens here? Not really what happens here. Speak directly to it
is no intercessor, no translation An is getting the God's words
through the simple very directly, which is a huge break with
tradition. And this is not what happens and is what happens in the
Iliad. But it's not what happens in Roman society. It's not what
happens in Greek society. It's not in Virgil's day with the command
symbol, actually. So this emphasizes the importance of the destiny
that the symbols reveal. So what is it that the symbol tells them
specifically? To where she says you can't get to the other world
unless you have a global. Yeah, I'll take that, she says a few things
before this, she tells him that his home, the place that he's looking
for because of course, she's speaking with the God she already knows
this prophecy that he does his home is really close in a place called
Latcham, which is just north of where he is. So his church is almost
over. He never knew exactly where he was going. Now he does. We have
always known that is the audience now, Anastacio. So he's almost
there in order to get into the well. That's the goal. That's not all
she tells him. She also tells him that he can if he wants to go into
the underworld. It's not really part of what he has to do. But
Odysseus had to go into the underworld because he had no idea how to
get home. He had to go to the underworld to seek out because only
Tiresias can help him get home. And he doesn't have to go to the
underworld. He chooses to, but he doesn't have to. But if he does, he
has to find this guy named Chris who has died down on the beach and
did not know that one of his crewmen had died. So this is a shock to
him. But he has to bury my sadness and they have to go find this
golden branch, which he does. Now, remember, there are someone who
died right before Dist. went to the underworld and he learns that he
has to bury this. This guy, Elenor, remember Opener's, the guy who
drinks on Seress roof and falls off and and breaks his neck. So this
is a Eleanor and is about to bury my status. So they go do that. Then
while they're doing that, two doves, which are the symbol of
Vanessa's mother, Venus, appear and guide him to this golden tree
where he snaps off a branch as a gift for Proserpina. It's his
passivity. This lets him go into the under the spell, what, two
hundred, almost three hundred lines just to set up the descent into
the underworld. A lot of a lot of conversation with a lot of
dialogue. I'll come back to why. All right, so we go into the room,
Hal. This is sales up to a nondescript island and just sort of walks.
How does any of us find it? How does he get there? Go to Astroland or
something. One of them river to be able to get into the underworld to
get the there. Now he has to find this river. I don't remember the
name of it as to find the river and cross that in the same way that a
soul or I should say so, in the same way that a spirit that's so he
is effectively leading us on a spirits afterlife across the river
into the underworld, not like Odysseus, but in the way that Virgil
kind of constructs this idea of what the Roman afterlife looks like.
An ass is going to to follow us through there, but it's important how
he finds it. Is he alone? Who's with them directly, Odysseus was
alone. No one went with him. He wandered around in the afterlife or
in the underworld, looking on his own, meeting people on his own. The
civil is leading. And that's a really important departure because
everything that we see in the underworld is coming because the symbol
once Anastacio, the symbol in the gods, want us of the audience to
see it, too. This is how Virgil establishes his authority with
knowledge of things that normal people shouldn't know. So we had this
descent into the underworld past these monsters, for instance. This
is a very terrifying transition. Why the monsters are there? Not
really terrifying, but it is a terrifying transition for him, for his
world that he knows into something completely different. And all
these monsters mark that transition. The first people you meet are
the unburied. This is where he talks with tourists who, by virtue of
dying at sea, is naturally unburied. This ties into the idea that a
person who is unburied has not received proper funeral rights and
therefore they are. Well, the Greeks had this idea that their purse
to wander forever, the Romans have it at softens them a little bit is
a curse to wander unburied and aimless for a thousand years before he
can cross the river. So there's a little bit of a difference here.
All right. So that marks this transition into the underworld. He
talks about interest and then once in the underworld, he meets people
who are actually dead, actually in the who does they need first? What
sort of people remember when Odysseus went through the underworld, it
wasn't just that he met people. He met types of people. And those
types were symbolic. Same way in the interior. So what group of
people does he need first? It's a very quiet today. So the heat,
that's fair enough. We need the tragic death. These are the people
who have died well, tragically, they died before their time. We are
about children who die before reaching adulthood. We care about
people who met unfortunate ends or tragic ends or like Dido, who met
their end for reasons that were not their own right. So we see Dido
come into the picture. Does she talk to a.. Really still, rather
understandably, angry. What does she do? And talk to their husband,
the one who actually loved her back right in front of an she turns
around, goes back to her first husband. It's like closing the door on
that that possibility that he wants that he can't go back to Carthage
because he now knows that she's dead even in the afterlife. She wants
nothing to do with him. So he has no choice but to move forward right
there at the beginning of the afterlife or to keep going. And right
there at the beginning of the underworld closes that door, forces
them to move forward. But before we move forward, he does meet some
people from his past. He meets the Trojan Hero's. Not the Greek
heroes, but this is not the heroes from his own side announcements,
the heroes from his own side. Remember that Virgil never wanted to
compete directly with Homer, never wanted to compete with the Iliad
or the Odyssey. So he's not going to completely rehash everything
that that Odysseus does in the underworld. He's going to tweak it
slightly to make it a little bit different for a Roman audience. So
we need the Trojan heroes among them to follow us. We learn about the
fall of Troy. This way, they follow us in certain traditions by this
point. Mary's Helen after after Paris is killed and it is Helen who
helps the Greeks take the city, helps them when the when the Trojan
horse goes into the city, the Greeks pop out. And ultimately it is
Helen who betrays the Greeks again, downplaying the Greek tradition
here to play up the Trojan side, which will ultimately become the
Roman said. And then, just like in The Odyssey, we hear about the
evil that as well, these are not just the same in The Odyssey. It's
not just people who are immoral, people who are flat out evil, who go
against the will of the gods, just like in Greek religion, you can be
an immoral person and have a relatively pleasant afterlife. It's that
what you do cannot possibly go against the gods. That's the idea
here. OK, now all of that set up. Leads to this, the blessed debt.
OK, and what are the blessed dead? Because in the afterlife of Homer,
everyone's just sort of down there on their own, right? Everyone goes
to the same place. If you're Curb's like if you do something really
horrible and the gods curse you, it's not just a death, but really
unpleasant afterlife. You go to a special part of the underworld, but
that's it. Outside of that special, horrible place, everything is
relatively the same. The Romans don't have that idea, though. They
have a different conception of the afterlife. What you do in life
matters again. You can be casually immoral, but you ultimately end up
in the right place. But it's different, there can be kind of a dismal
afterlife and then there can be an awesome afterlife. How do you get
into that awesome place? What kinds of people does an estimate among
the blessed that. People who. I. People do put the the importance of
Rome above themselves to sacrifice themselves for the city. Who else?
Poets, we need. Well, self serving on Virgil's part, but we need
poets and the blessed that. And he needs his father. So people who
have served the city, who have served the people of Rome, the
interests of the states, they go to the special good afterlife. It's
a different Roman construction. Among the nine cases, its father, and
this is where we transition to the civil, has been leading him
through a general sort of overview of the afterlife. And now his
father will take over and show him something different when he shows
him as the point of why he's in the underworld in the first place,
because it is to see the future of Rome. This is the core of the
chapter excuse me, the core of the book here. It's relatively short,
comparatively, but that's the point. There's a lot that's packed into
that prophecy, future of Rome. So we start with and ask his direct
descendants who will become the kings of all the Lunga, not the kings
of Rome. That happens later. We meet the kings of all the longer and
we get a brief descent from there. And then we jump a millennium or
two down to the agencies around Augustus or we hear about them. And
then we go back in time for Caesar Augustus, back to the very first
Roman kings, to the kingdom of Olonga. Ultimately in this line down
here, one of the kings of all the longest, Numata, whose daughter is
the mother of Romulus and Remus, Romulus, the founder of Rome. So
that's how Rome and all along are connected. And we get that
genealogy presented here with Caesar and Augustus kind of put it in
there. It's a very small ring composition of how we get from the
founders, the immediate descendants of an ass down to the present day
noble families. But the Romans are uncomfortable with their kingship,
did not end well. It ended quite disastrously. And so forever after
that, the word king in Latin has some rather negative connotations.
So for a Virgil to be talking about this in positive terms, it's a
little bit. And so we very quickly have to transition. We can't dwell
on the benefits of things too much because that also makes us a
little bit iffy. So he very quickly pivots to talk about a different
set of heroes, heroes of the Old Republic. We hear about the virtues
that they had, the battles that they fought, and he goes through a
lot of names very, very quickly. I'm not going to go through all of
that. But the one thing that the heroes do that he does linger on is
that they conquer Greece. The mission of Rome is to expand its
geography and one of the places they expand is Greece, which
emphasizes the justice of faith. And so the Greeks go to try. They
destroy choice. They make it as a refugee and all of these people.
But one day that we all are going to turn and he and his people will
have vengeance. So the Roman conquest of everything isn't just fate,
it's justice. That's how all of this is couched. And we know from
Hesiod that justice is an important thing, an epic tradition that
carries a lot of historical weight. So Virgil is tying into that as
well. And to underscore the connection back to that, if anyone
doesn't really pick up on that, we hear about the fate of the two.
Mark Kelly. Now, this is a bit of a historical compilation. There's a
marquis who lives. Somewhere, somewhere, the to. Up to 60, something
who receive special honors for. So what did he do? It was a general
and as the general, he led his troops into battle, where he engaged
in single combat with the enemy. King killed him, stripped of the
enemy King's armor and lived to tell about it. And this is like an
older a much, much older style of combat that he was performing in
front of his troops and in front of the enemy army that won him
special armor, special honors from the Roman Senate. He got statues
of himself put up. And it just so happens that one of Augustus's
nephews who was alive at this time was also named Martellus. So
Virgil is intentionally conflating those two names to make the
descendants of Augustus seem like the heroes of the Old Republic. The
younger Marquis Augustus's nephew was like 12 at the time this is
written, so he's clearly not on par with any of these. But all of
this is the prophecy of Rome. This is what he shows them to. To give
in is some sort of purpose. It's actually the symbol that gives him
purpose, the symbols. This is where you will go. This tells us
something he did not know before that who tells him why? Civilians on
purpose. And he gives them a reason for it all. And then it ends
pretty quickly. They turn around and they. Now, there's a lot
happening there. No. One, this went to the underworld that this nice
composition, right? Not as much happening, not as many people being
mentioned. It's nice to simple nose ring, but that's not what's
happening here. It's not structured in that way because Virgil is
writing all of this down. He doesn't need to rely on that ring
composition in order to remember a much more complex plot. Virgil can
have this all written down in front of him. He doesn't need to
structure it that way. But that doesn't mean there's no structure at
all. Wondering if anyone sees a structure in this. There is one.
Anyone have any guesses as to how that might be structured? I see
this. Begin with the prophecy of the gods, we already know what it is
supposed to do, but again, now the signal tells him exactly what that
is, gives him some details that he didn't have before. And then we
get to the power play where we're infant, that we are continually
made aware that what we do in life actually matters in the old
Oddisee and tradition, the old Homeric tradition, what we do in life
doesn't really matter. No one notices us in the underworld. He meets
Achilleas, who actively regrets all of his choices above ground. If
he could trade all of his fame, all of his glory for just any more
time above ground, he would. It's a pretty big repudiation of these
old Homeric ideals, old epic ideas of what a hero is. And that's what
Achilles actually wants. He wants to give up all of that. Here we
learn something kind of in the same vein, what we do in life actually
matters. You don't just go down to the afterlife and live there
dismally for the rest of time. There are different portions of the
afterlife for different people. If there's a there's a philosophy
here and a moralizing that goes along with what the afterlife looks
like. And all of that's important because there's this idea of kind
of reincarnation after a thousand years in the or in the underworld,
you get to come back, but only if you've been that good kind of
person. And so you have to be a good person to get to the good part
of the afterlife. And if you're there, you can come back. So there's
a there's a religious philosophy going along with this and buried in
that is how the Roman people are going to survive by adhering to
these old virtues, by adhering to these moral qualities that have
that have made the Trojan people what they are. Even though it didn't
quite work out well for the Trojans by adhering to these old
qualities, it will ensure the survival of the Roman people. All of
this ties in to Virgil's own death because Augustus is really, really
keen on these old ideas. He really thinks that the the reason Rome
has had all of these civil wars up to him becoming emperor is because
the Romans have forgotten about all of those old virtues. They've
forgotten how to be a people, how to be a society, and only by
rediscovering those older virtues that all of these heroes of the Old
Republic, all of the old heroes from their own mythology, embodied
only by rediscovering that can the Roman people actually survive all
of this ties into these Augustan programs. And it's very tough, the
idea of piety, that's. It's not as clean of a structure or
construction as the Odyssey, but I think that's what it's going for.
So following this, we have. That's pretty straightforward, actually.
That's not actually a whole lot of action that happens. The Trojans
land in Italy where people know that they are coming. They've been
told we have a King Latina's. This is a the founder of the Latin
people here who has a daughter who engaged to a guy named Pernice
Tyrannosaurs, that it's not the king's strongest warrior, the hero of
the neighboring people who are not Latin. They're the ritually. And
the king's daughter is supposed to marry Turness. He breaks that
alliance, breaks that engagement to marry his daughter off to an
asks. Turness is not happy. He rallies all of the other tribes to
make war against the Latin's. And on mass rallies, some other allies
to fight them all, among which are some a great guy, an inventor who
just so happens to have a city nearby eventer trust his his son named
Palace. To an asset protection that's important later. And so
basically it sets up this conflict between Hamas and the Latins and
their allies and us and the British and their allies. This sounds
like the setup for the Trojan War. Both sides gathering their allies
and fighting. And as if to underscore that parallel, we have Venus
coming down and giving divine armor to an ass in much the same way
that that Achilles got divine armor from his mother. So we're really
hammering in the parallels here, except Virgil knows this history and
at this point in time. There's not much that's Roman Rome doesn't
even exist, the Latin people are just this very small part of central
Italy and it's not even all of that. It's just the cities. You're
just in cities in orange here. That's what the Latins are. That's the
Latin's of a slightly later period, even so for what Virgile is
actually writing about that early, earliest history, it's not even
all of that. It's just that. That small group of cities over there by
the Tiba or the Latin's, the other cities down there by the coast.
Are. And it's just this tiny little conflict. When we looked at the
Trojan War as it was set up, not necessarily in the Iliad, but the
whole rest of the tradition, we had the whole world coming to Troy.
We have people coming to to help the Trojans from Ethiopia. We have
people coming from the central city and stuff to come help the
Trojans fight the Greeks. The Greeks are standing against the entire
world, as it seems. And this is not Virgil is playing it up because
everyone knows this history is entire audience knows this history.
They know the relatively insignificant origins of Rome because
they're kind of proud of that. So in the absence of this this epic
tradition to draw, he's playing up the drama and the emotions. So
when we when we go forward and look at how Turness is defeated, it is
very emotional because it has to be the plotline just isn't there for
anything grander. So what we see is a turness rallies his allies in
tax, the Trojan camps, and just like we see in the early reaches, the
gates kills a whole bunch of Trojan heroes, but ultimately can't hold
on to the ground. And he runs away. Now, how he runs away is
important. He escapes by diving into the Tigris River and swimming
away. Remember, this hero breaks and defeats a whole bunch of
enemies, jumps into the Tiber and survives. We're going to come back
to this on Tuesday. Yeah, so just remember that for now, after the
battle, there's this divided council again, pretty much like we would
see in the Iliad where Venus and Jupiter talk about what to do. There
are there's a continuation of fighting. But this way, in a very
Italian sort of way, we have these duels between Trojan, Greek,
Italian, Ridgeley, these duels between heroes, the very Italian way
of fighting. When you read Roman history, especially the very
earliest history, you get armies being mustered to go fight against
one another. But before they actually fight, you have families of
heroes who will leave the armies and duel each other in the middle of
the battlefield. And often the outcome of that duel decides that
everyone can go home. One city will now be a subject of the other,
but the two armies don't have to slaughter each other on the field.
So this is a very Italian way of fighting and we get that reflected.
Unfortunately, for instance, one of the people who dies is pilots,
that Greek son of the Vandar who is trusted to and asks for
protection. This kid is killed much like. Patrick was killed, the
cousin, friend, lover of Achilles, and that's what draws Achilles
back into the war. Angered by his death, Achilleas marches that can
kill Hector and pretty much everyone else needs. And so this is what
draws this into into the war, more than just fighting duels, but into
a war where the or the Julians attorneys have to be destroyed. So
what gives him. Purpose here. So the very last book of the epic We
Have an To is finally facing off. They face off in single combat to
decide the fate of William Turness, recently rescued by a sister and
his wounded buddies killed by Venus. There's a lot of back and forth
here and the duel resumes. Turness is very quickly overwhelmed at
wounded. And then he does something that we would never see. And he
begs. The Homeric heroes never back. They have to meet their death
calmly. They might not like the situation. They came back in Turness
death, doesn't beg for his own life, but he begs something perfectly
reasonable that his body be returned to his father, either alive or
if an answer is absolutely bent on killing him, at least let his body
be returned. Even Hector was returned after he was killed. They said,
Yeah, yeah, well, I didn't do it. And that was the shame of Achilles
that is only righted by prime sneaking into the Greek camp at night
and reclaiming his body. And this is essentially witnesses is asking
here and then this is about to do it. We hear about his sword. Hand
is raised. He's about to kill Turness and his hand starts to shake.
Can't quite bring it, bring it upon himself to kill him until he
notice notices that Turness is wearing some armor that Palus had been
wearing. And he remembers that this boy that he had been supposed to
have been protecting had been killed by terrorists on hand. And so
Turness is executed. Wounded enemy at his mercy and an as kills him.
And that's it, they're like two more lines after this and the attack
just sort of ends. Now, remember that the Aeneid was unfinished when
Virgil died. So it's entirely possible that there were a few more
lines that were going to be added to the end of this to sort of round
it off and not make it quite so abrupt. But then again, all of the
epics in the Hellenistic period end very abruptly. A lot of other
Roman epics, as we will see in very abruptly, there's not really a
conclusion. And so it is entirely possible that this is what Virgil
intended. We just don't know. But it is a very, very abrupt ending.
All right, let's break this down a little bit. All right, so with
language and performance, we talked about a lot of this stuff. It's a
very descriptive style. It's very short and a lot of staccato
sentences for effect, emotional effect. He wants us to feel who these
people are. He wants us to feel their motivations. He wants us to
identify with them. And he really wants us to identify not just in
terms of Book six here, but he really wants us to identify with
Pernice, with data, with these these obstacles that NASA faces in his
quest to found a new people to find his home. And this while this
does a lot of things, I'll come back to that, but he's really going
for this emotional response. However, I have to pause there because
it's important to recognize that some of this language, some of this
emotional appeal is not actually in the lap. And a lot of that has to
do with the the religious aspects here. So I like the translation I
gave you. It's it's clear it's engaging, but it is rather modern in
places. So, for example, you get this this line here, the unlovely
water binds them to hell. These are people who have. And this is the
people who have taken their own lives. They regret that decision.
They regret sending themselves to the underworld to early. They wish
they could go back to the land of the living, but they can't here
because the the water of health binds them there, holds them. They're
the Latin actually says faith forbids them to return to the land of
living. And a mournful swamp of repulsive water binds them to the
land of the dead to where they are. The agencies rather different
here. It's not that they're stuck in the underworld, that the fates
have decided what they are going to do and that they should stay
there. The fates have spun out a thread of life quite literally, and
then they take a knife and they cut the end of that thread. When I
cut that thread of your life, you're dead. Nothing in the world can
bring you back. The gods themselves are subject to what the fates
have decreed. No, Jupiter's role is not to make sure that something
happens. His role is to make sure that what the fates have decreed
happens. So even Jupiter, most powerful of the Roman gods, is bound
to face. We also know health care is a very Judeo-Christian reading
of this underworld. A few lines later, souls, when they have rolled
the wheel of time, come through a thousand years and we'll be called
by God, God with a capital G Latin, that's actually the monies which
are not souls. These are the sort of generic spirits of the dead.
When they've rolled the wheel a thousand times through the years,
they the God, the unspecified but respectfully titled God calls them
the Romans were perfectly happy not knowing who the gods were talked
about with the Hittites. Hittites had the they inhabited the land of
the Thousand Gods, literally everything had some sort of divine
force. The Romans do rocks and trees and springs and divine forces.
They might not know what divine force that is. There might not be a
name for it, but the Romans recognized that it's there. And so they
had to be respectful of these divine forces, even if they didn't know
what they were called. So we get this this title, the God, it's it's
respectful. It's unspecified. They don't want to insult the God by
giving him a name that's wrong. And so they just leave it as the God.
We're the Romans, similar to the Greeks that they didn't like saying
the names of underworld gods. Greeks would refer to eighties as
Pluton to avoid directly saying the same with Romans similar in that
regard as well. Not quite. The there were destructive gods that they
would not reference in certain situations, but there were other
situations where it's perfectly reasonable to do the monies and the
God. The monies are perfectly acceptable. The reference is just like
spirit literally of our English word spirit and then the the God, the
unspecified God. That's just that's the word for God. So that's
acceptable to use. So these are some general conceptions here that
the translator is putting in, and I call your attention to it for a
couple of reasons. One, because periodically throughout the class.
Right. Pointed out the influence of the translator and what that what
sort of influence that is or gives us the impression that it gives
us. Another thing, though, is because all of this is pretty important
for later history. There's a reason that Virgil survives or rather
there's a reason that the Indians survives. It was hugely
influential. It was really important in the adjustment period. It
became the national ethic of the Romans. It didn't stay that way
forever. There is a point at which people stop reading the Aeneid.
They still call themselves Roman, but they're not reading the it in
the entire eastern half of the Empire. That is primarily Greek
speaking. They're not reading the Indian. They're calling themselves
Roman. They can't quote the NEA to save their lives. And so what this
what it becomes is an allegory of knowledge, of Roman knowledge, but
also of religious knowledge. When early Christian philosophers are
trying to figure out aspects of the theology, when they're trying to
figure out what the afterlife is going to look like, they look to
Virgile because they've all read Virgil. They all already have this
picture of the afterlife in their mind. And so it's very easy to see
how the picture that Virgil paints here becomes the Christian
afterlife. So that contributes to that. I'll come back to this idea
later to. But let's talk about the hero for a second. Unlike some
places or some epics that we read where it's not really clear who the
hero is, really, obviously the hero here is to ask what do we see and
do what marks his actions as heroic or what are his heroic actions?
Or he goes to his face like we willingly like he follows the will of
the gods and acts in very, I guess some like a noble way or action
hero. Yeah, yeah. I only intended to pop up on my duty because when
you hear the. And then I see this very pious, right? I say this is
the guy who went to Buri&aacute;n, these pious, he immediately does
everything that he has to do for the gods and for his own people. And
then he is himself divine, which works really well for gospel. So
he's trying to link himself into this bloodline. So he is bound by
duty to the gods because he is bound into that family relationship.
In Roman culture, as we're going to see in several epics, your family
is who you owe your allegiance to, your allegiance to Rome, of
course, but also your family and your family comes first, second. So
he's bound by all of this duty. And what he has to do is. But what he
thinks he has to do, he does almost to a fault, so Turness is enemy
painting here is not from the spirit that gets the point across
tennis's his enemy. And so Turness must be destroyed, must be removed
from his obstacle, Dido. However, he may have felt about data that it
was an obstacle to his fate. She had to be removed from his path to a
fault. He is removing these obstacles in pursuit of his of what he
understands his destiny to be. Heidi, Heidi, to the gods fate and
family. What else do we learn about a heroic hero's job from this
book? So it's not just that Imus is himself a hero, he's seen a lot
of heroes in the underworld. They're literally queued up as if on a
conveyor belt to go into this this portal that will bring them into
the back into the world after a thousand years of death, all of the
heroes that he meets, all of the future from his perspective, kings
of all the London and Rome, all of the heroes of the republic,
Augustus, his own nephew. All of these are heroes. What do they
embody? What are their heroic qualities? You get this line, it's two
lines here. These are important lines. Encases tells him that his
faith tells on his faith to rule the world, establish peace. Spare
the humble and conquer the proud. This is not just an ascites future.
This is the future destiny of all Romans. This is what the Romans
understood themselves to be doing as they're going out and conquering
all of the other people, they are conquering the proud. While they're
conquering the proud in order to bring justice, in order to protect
those who cannot protect themselves, they are conquering all of these
peoples in order to establish peace for their own people and
ultimately to rule the world, but to rule it effectively and
efficiently, to rule it as it needs to be in their understanding of
things. So this is the destiny not just to get up and asked, but of
all Romans. And this is that heroic quality that bridges the gap
between the heroes of of mythic past and Roman heroes in an everyday
historical sense. Remember this, because we're going to see parodies
of that line throughout other things that we're going to read. You
also have to be just generally a good person, and if what matters or
what you experience in the afterlife depends on what you do in life,
if what you do in life matters for the afterlife, then you kind of
have to be a good person. All of these people who are going through
that portal into the next life, all of these future Roman heroes,
they were good people. That's why they get to go through and do this.
That's why they get to be reincarnated. So, yeah, you have to fight
for your country, priests and poets and soldiers, people who reveal
life's truths to the masses. This is the point of a narrator of epic
poetry dating all the way back to the beginning. They reveal things
that shouldn't otherwise be known, but they do it because the gods
allow them to write some revealing truths. People generally who
enrich the lives of everyone else. These are people who get to be
reborn. These are people who get to be Roman in this conception. And
you have to be a good person because that's one of the defining
characteristics of being Roman. It's very, very kind of
propagandistic, but it fits really well with what Augustus was trying
to do by bringing back these old Roman virtues to to revive Roman
society, at least at least as he saw. All right, so we did get a
narrator's voice here showing us last calls himself one of the good
people who we get to go to this good afterlife. But he still
ultimately along for the ride and he doesn't always know exactly
what's going to happen. He tells us that several times that even if
he had a thousand tongues for a thousand years, he couldn't quite
finish telling all of the wonders or horrors that forget exactly line
seven. Forty four there is taken almost straight out of the Iliad or
Odyssey tradition or both. Actually, in this case, Homer uses this
phrase quite a lot. And Virgil copies it, inserting himself in there.
But again, it's a little bit different. He is just sort of along for
the ride and he's writing all of this. So it's not quite in the same
way. And all of that, again, ties into the literary background, the
references to especially The Odyssey, but also the Iliad. It's not
always well, there's so many references. I'm not going to go through
everything, but some of these references are more subtle than others.
And the whole structure is a play on The Odyssey 11. But there are
other things. So they find the symbol at the beach. This is he's
working in a lot of history into this into this book in the same way
that he did with the book for the civil Kumai, whom I was at one
point a colony of various different cities from the Greek island of
Cuba, come together and sail off to Italy and found the city of
Kumai. This is a reference to various historical traditions in Italy.
And then this idea that this is destiny, it's not just destiny, it's
this idea of justice and completion. All of the wrongs in the old
cycle, especially the Iliad, all of these wrongs are going to be
righted by an artist and his descendants. So there's some some subtle
manipulation of that historical tradition here. We do get epic
similes. Sometimes they work with history lessons the same way that
everything else is, but usually it's just for flavor. And this is how
most of these epic similes are going to be in the Roman tradition
type scenes that really actually we get a funeral from. I say this is
buried as formulaic descriptions, but it's not really a type scene.
We don't get enough of the description of the funeral. So so Virgil's
focus is elsewhere. He's still focused on impressions and
description, emotional effect. He's not really concerned with all of
these these epic conventions. But he is concerned with, again, its
history, and so we get these poetic and epic confrontations with
Chronicles working history into the epic tradition, working history
into the mythic tradition. We've seen this throughout Roman epic so
far. We're going to see the other side of that on Tuesday when we
look at Libya and how Libya is describing Roman history. The reason
that this was so successful. The reason that Virgil could write like
this and everyone accepts it is because the Romans already thought of
their own history as an epic right. Even when they're not
intentionally writing it. Letizia's the historian is not a poet, but
he's the way that he describes history is very poetic. It is very
epic, as you guys will see on Tuesday. So Virgil is working within
this tradition? No, he's not creating it. He's working within it. We
look at the social background again as we look for a lot of it plays
on religion, so the whole setup of this whole reason, an ass is
allowed to go to the underworld. The reason he is allowed to see this
very direct, a glimpse of the future is because he is an Kumai.
Talking to the civil Roman audience would have understood this to be
a reference to the Civil War Kumai that they themselves knew in their
own in their own day. There's an entire priesthood dedicated to
reading the books that the symbol of Kumite gave to the Romans or
rather sold to the Romans. There's a story that the symbol of Kumai
is his wandering prophet prophetess wandering Oracle down in Cooma.
And she walks. She walks up to to Rome. To the king is one of the
ones with nine scrolls. This is not the as any Roman emperor, but I
like the scrolls that she's carrying. So she wanders up to one of the
Roman kings with these nine scrolls under her arm. These are books of
prophecy that she has written, things that will help the Romans
navigate the future. And she offers to sell them to the king of Rome
for a large sum of money. And he says, no, Rome. Isn't that isn't
that wealthy? I can't buy your books. So she goes away. She burns
three books. That's the smoke behind her in that painting. She comes
back the next day with six books and says, I will sell you these six
books of prophecy for the same large amount of money. And the king
says, I sell books. I don't know what you want from me. Go away. So
she goes back and burns three more. She comes back the next day with
three books, says, I will sell you three books of prophecy, those
three books for the same exact large amount of money. At this point,
the king is like a contestant on a game show. He really wants the
books because he knows what's going to happen if he says no. So
basically, Rome goes over its entire supply of money to the Civil and
gets these books and they develop an entire priesthood whose job it
is to look after these books to to copy them and make sure that they
don't go away. At one point they are burned. But the priests.
Miraculously rewrite them. Let's go with that and essentially what
they do is any time Rome has a crisis and not just something,
something bad is happening, but like an existential crisis, like when
Hannibal is marching on the city and it seems like he's going to
destroy it, they consult these these books of oracles. They consult
the will of the gods directly through what the simple gave them. And
so this kind of plays into what Virgil is doing with an S. This is an
existentially critical moment for the Roman people. It's not at all
clear at this point in the epic that ananas is actually going to be
successful. They're still half the epic left. Everyone kind of knows
that he's going to be successful. But in the context of the story,
there's still a lot that could happen that could go wrong. He still
has to fight off Turness. He still has to do all of the other things
that the Roman audience expects him to do to fight for his homeland.
So by bringing the symbol in here, we're referencing Cymbeline books
and their importance in Virgil's day all the way back into the very
beginning of Roman tradition. And we also have lots of ideologies and
justifications, place names, burials, things that we've seen in other
other epics up to this point, and that because vigilance is concerned
with behavior. And again, this idea of good and bad behavior, what
constitutes bad behavior, what constitutes good behavior, he presents
this moralizing philosophy of life. What sorts of qualities are
understood to be good not just for heroes, but for everyday people?
And likewise, what sorts of qualities are understood to be bad? When
Odysseus went to the underworld, it was just the hero's it was just
the mythological figures that he met, that's all The Odyssey was
concerned with for Virgil. He's concerned with society because
Augustus is concerned with society. And so within this religious
tradition, you get Virgil gives us a lot of details about what's
actually happened. So, for example, we hear a lot about the
sacrifice, Macias with this. There have been an appropriate
sacrifice. In the underworld. Exactly. So there are very specific
things that have to happen in specific ways in order for Roman
religion to work the way that it should. We saw this with great
religion as well. Virgil gives us a lot of these details because
that's what the Roman audience would expect. Right. So the importance
of faith ties into all of that. Again, protected by Jupiter, the gods
themselves are subject to the fates. You can pray to the gods. The
gods will help you if they can. They're not leveling the playing
field the way that the Greek gods were. But the Greek gods jobs job
is to kind of do what they do. But they help mortals out by leveling
the playing field, by removing obvious obstacles. But it's still the
job of mortals to take the steps to ensure that what needs to happen
does if you're successful. Good job. If you're not, it's your own
fault. The gods have done what they can with Roman religion. The
fates have already spun out the basic outline of your life. They
don't spend all of the details. They spend the major stuff. The gods
fill in those details in a good way or that way. So that's where the
role of prayer is. We get this line here for fifty five and six. Stop
hoping that the gods decrees can be met with prayers and the fates
have already spun out the course of a person's life. Praying about
these things won't matter in the Roman religion. And this idea that I
already mentioned, the Roman underworld is not like the Greek
underworld. It's divided by how a person live their life. There's a
good place and there is a bad place. It's still the same underworld,
but there is a good place and a bad place. And this is why later
tradition went back to Virgil. This is why Virgil was copied and
recopied and recopy. A significant chunk of ancient Roman writings
and Greek writings did not survive. We have lost like 90 percent of
everything that was written in these two cultures. The reason that
anything survived is not the reason anything. The reason a lot of
things survived is because they could be allegories by early
Christian tradition, so people could look at Greek philosophy, people
could look at Roman stories and epics like this and find something
that made sense within an early Christian cultural context. They
could read into it a Christian religious meaning. And so, again, one
of the reasons that the Aeneid survives is because it was so
influential in certain areas and certain parts of Roman society that
when Christianity began to spread through the Empire, people could
look back to the Aeneid for influence as to how to understand
Christian theology. And that's why when Dante wrote his Divine
Comedy, that's why Virgil gives the tour through the underworld. It's
because of the DNA, because of Virgil's importance in constructing
that idea of the afterlife. You get this idea of reincarnation, talk
about how that's important to understand and emphasize that these are
all things that are believed and thought by Romans of Virgil's DE.
But there's a lot of variety here. No one Roman would necessarily
believe everything that Virgil is saying, but some aspect of what he
is saying is going to appeal to someone, somewhere in the empire. And
Virgil is writing what he's writing in order to to hook as many
people as he possibly can. And that is the ultimate point of the
epic. Virgil is trying to figure out why not figure out the right
about how this tiny little state of lack of here, led by a tiny,
insignificant city, became back by Augustus's Day, became a world
power that had conquered pretty much all the Mediterranean. How did
it happen? It all happened because of fate, not the fate of the Roman
people to do all of this, but because everything that led from this
to this has been building to this day, it seems like there's a reason
that he chose to portray himself like this as a priest. He's choosing
to to emphasize his divine nature, his divine favor, and the fact
that everything that has been building up to this point built toward
Augustus, every life that had ever been lived in the city of Rome,
every man, woman and child who had lived and died had lived and died
because it was leading to him. He was the pinnacle of Roman
civilization. That's the idea. The ideal, rather, that Virgin was
playing up. And there is comfort in that. I mean, we talked about
this at the end of last class. There's comfort in the idea of faith
at the end of a pretty traumatic period when a significant portion of
the city has been killed in a series of civil wars. There's comfort
in the idea that it was all for a reason, that it all left something
us. Here is what that is. And then I said, all right, now this idea
does not last really that long ago. This is a pretty effective. By
all accounts, his descendants are not really. Caligula got his horse,
appointed a Senator Nero. While the city burned down and then he used
a third of it to build a pleasure palace. Yeah, it's a good story,
though. It's in so, Tony, yes, I think it was pretty anti-coagulant
anyway, yeah, it probably is apocryphal, but it does get to his
Matus. Februaries was a better idea of the entire body of Dynarski.
There is it does. This thing is great. Then there's quality as long
as it's pretty good. It wasn't that bad, especially compared to
everyone else. Tiberius was like very cool and very cranky. And his
old age, he was besta he withdrew from the people in a way that was
not acceptable in Roman standards. And then the other two. Yeah,
yeah, Nero had his moments at the beginning, but he descended quickly
and this descent into madness is something that is going to be the
focus of the next epic. So on Tuesday, we're going to read some
background as to how the Romans understood their own history. And
then on Thursday, we're going to read a different epic written in a
very different time that looks back to this period of idealism. And
it doesn't necessarily look back on that period with a glowing rosy
lens. So any final questions before I let you guys go? All right,
have a good.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_d0ar30ojoezg"></a>Dionysiaca</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">OK. All right, so so today we're
looking at Nonnus, and it is a very different kind of writing style.
I don't know what you guys thought about it being on Zoom. It's hard
to have a conversation about things. Did anyone have trouble reading
Nonnus? Any any preliminary thoughts about what you guys read? It's
OK, if not. There was like for me, it seemed like there's like a lot
of references to things and mythology, like a lot of names are kind
of being thrown out. And I was like, well, what's happening? Yeah,
this is it's called it's part of what's called the jewelled style,
where all of these myths and references, they're part of their Jewelz
in his writing style and they don't actually do anything. They're
like jewels. They're they're pretty. They're interesting to look at.
But they don't actually contribute anything to the substance of what
he's saying. And it makes for a very different kind of read. And for
that reason, Nonnus was. Not well thought of for a very, very long
time, Nonnus has never been popular. I know lots of people who have
read individual books of Nanase for various research purposes. I
don't know anyone who has ever read the entirety of the epic, like
there are scholars who work on honest. I'm sure they read it. I don't
personally know any classicists or archaeologist or anyone who
studies ancient anything who has actually sat down and read the
Dionysiac cover cover to cover, which is telling. And one of the
reasons for that is because it's it's just it's kind of hard to get
through, but it's also just one of these epics that's really.
Different and kind of awful when you start to read parts of it, and
that's part of what I want to talk about today. By the way, let me
point out that as I'm talking, I the way that Zoome works for me is
I'm very limited in what I can see on the screen. So if you have a
question, just go ahead and say, hey, Dr. Baden's question, because I
might not see your screen if you're trying to raise your hand, if you
post anything in the chat screen and I don't address it for a while,
just keep posting and eventually I'll see that the little number tick
up. Nonnus is very rarely translated for all of these reasons that I
mentioned. It's kind of hard to get through and it's really awkward
and a lot of the things that that Nonnus is talking about. And so
there is literally one English translation ever, and it's from
nineteen forty and it has been translated into Latin and French and
German modern Greek. There is a modern French translation from the
nineteen nineties I think. But that's it, it's just, it's rarely
translated. And we've seen before about how translators can insert
their own ideas into the text and how that sometimes affects how we
think about the ancient text in the ancient author. And with Nonnus
here we really, really see that in a way that we haven't before. And
so there are some really negative examples here. And so as I'm
reading through this on on page two seventy four, note a there
there's a big old red flag because even in nineteen forty, this is
not the language that I would expect to read in a scholarly
translation of an ancient text, not to mention this, this weird
explanation of the conflation of Indians and Ethiopians based solely
on skin color, which is not really an ancient Greek idea. You'll
sometimes hear it said that the ancients did not have an idea of
race, and that's absolutely not true. They totally had had a native
race. It just manifests differently. And it does not manifest based
on on skin color for the most part. And so this is this is a really
strange note to me. And so the first time I read this, it made me
stop and go back and take a much closer look at the text in the Greek
to see what Nonnus was actually saying. And what I found is this,
this is the English that you guys read, and this is the the Greek
with the two the two words highlighted in color coded here. And the
two words in question are located on and across and located on just
means curly haired, literally curled hair. It doesn't have any
connotation of anything beyond hair that simply does not lay flat on
your head. It is literally currently going across is Kuwano Skin
Kuwano Skin. Kono's is a very complicated word. We've talked before
or I mentioned. I think when we looked at the the idea of translation
as an art, when we looked at the Iliad book, one talked about how
skin color are not certain, that skin color, how color terms in
general are very culturally specific. And one is, is one of these
color terms. We don't have a good approximation for it. In English,
it is dark blue, as in the dark blue of a calm sea. When it's
reflecting the sky, it is also gray, as in the color of a sea. When
it is storming or old iron that has become kind of a dark gray color
generally just means dark. It's not. It's never in the sense of black
as it has been taken here. And the interesting thing about both of
these words and these these compounds and the ideas that they
represent is that when you look at other Greek literature, especially
Holmer, which Nonnus is directly drawing on, we see these ideas
referred to or used to refer to Greeks themselves. So here in The
Odyssey Book nineteen, this is when Odysseus is lying to Penelope
about where he's been for for 20 years. He's talking about this this
friend of his who left Ithaca with him. So this this derivatives is a
Greek hero who left Ithica with Odysseus en route to to fight. And
Troy and Odysseus describes the realities as round in the shoulders,
which we've seen before. This broad shoulder idea means that he's
very strong, is a masculine, epic virtue. But also he is dark
skinned, as in he spent his entire life outside, burned by the sun.
And so his tanned, darkened skin is a mark of a virtue of masculine
virtue, heroic virtue. And he has curly hair because he just has
curly hair. So the way that it's been translated here with Nonnus,
the way that these translators have taken it, these words are
negatively translated. They indicate something that is negative about
the Indian population here. But that's not at all what's in the
Greek. That's not how these words are used. And I really don't think
that's how a Greek population would have originally read these words.
It's simply a description of appearance, not with the the kind of
moralizing tone that is given in the English translation. And so
there are problems with this translation. Again, it's the only
translation of Nonnus that there is if there was another one, I would
happily use it. But there are problems when we look at these these
older translations. And the first is that they're kind of awful just
in general. They don't paint a very good picture of anything. And the
second is that they often make it seem like this is kind of what
Classic's is that the classics and these ancient texts and the study
of ancient peoples is all about these misogynistic and racist views
of the world. And if that's what we spend all of our time reading as
classicists, then what must we be like also? And we're not there. We
are very aware today of this this baggage that we have inherited
within our discipline. And we're not doing this anymore. We're trying
to confront this legacy very, very intentionally. And lastly. Were we
in class, I would ask you guys what descriptions like this made you
think of Nonnus? What made what made you think of his his life, what
it made you think of his epic and what the point of his epic actually
was? And we have to understand that he is he is himself writing very
late. He is Christian writing about dinosaurs, but he is also
Egyptian. He was born, raised and spent his entire life in Egypt at
this time. And so when we approach things that he is saying about the
world, we really have to understand this, because what he is saying
really cannot be taken at face value the way that the translators
appear to have to have taken it. And so we really have to ask
ourselves, what would a Grecco Egyptian author living in Egypt really
confuse India and Ethiopia, or would he not be able to distinguish
between any of the many groups of people that were known at this time
with darker skin colors? And I think the answer is no. I think that
that he would obviously have been able to distinguish between these
people who would not have confused this the way that the authors or
rather the translators have indicated. And we have to remember that,
that a lot of these ideas are bound up very differently in the
ancient world. For example, I don't know if you remember, but when we
talked about the epic cycle, there's one of these lost epics that we
have today preserved only in fragments called the Ethiopians, and
that's the Ethiopian epic. And it's it's not a negative epic. There
are not negative stereotypes in that Memnon, the hero of the epic,
the king of the Ethiopians, travels to try to defend the Trojans
against the Greeks. And Memnon is described as the equal of Achilles.
In every possible respect. He has the same heroic virtues. He is
portrayed as a strong and generous and fully a hero in the best Greek
tradition. But this is not the stereotype that we see in the
translation. And I think this has to do with the reputation that that
Nonnus and the Dionysiac had in general at this point in time. So if
we look at the introduction to this work, specifically to this
translation, we get a rather dim appraisal of Nonnus and the
Dionysiac. We hear about the Dionysiac having the longest and most
elaborate examples of Greek myths in their final stage of degeneracy.
Nonas is sickly and has a sickly and unwholesome fancy. He has no
idea what to do with his heroes, and each series of adventures that
he sends them on is more tiring than the last one. And again, he's
only useful for studying mythology and its final degenerate forms.
This is not a good appraisal of maleness. I really have to wonder why
these translators decided to make this translation. They Rousse, the
main translator, made his reputation translating works from the
better part of a thousand years earlier. Plato and Homer and
classical and archaic poets Nonnus. He really seems to have nothing
but contempt for. And that kind of comes across in the way that that
all of the characters in the Dionysiac are portrayed. This this
horrible picture that we have of Dionysus in the Dionysiac is partly
because that's Ulmanis is writing it, but it's also partly
attributable to the translator. And so, again, were we in class, I
would at this point ask you guys to think about this, how, how how we
reconcile this, we know that Nonnus was Grecco Egyptian. We know that
he was living in a multicultural society in Alexandria, in Egypt, and
he was Christian. And we know that at least some of the negative
portrayals of of the gods and the myths and the peoples in the epic
were not actually attributable to Nonnus himself. And we I really
want you to pause for a second and think about how this might change
your understanding of Nonnus, of his Dionysiac and what you might
think he's actually writing about. Now, I'm not going to break you
guys up into into chat groups and talk about this, but just real
quickly, does anyone have a thought about what he might actually be
writing about? Because he's writing about the God in ISIS, but why?
It's known as. All right, we'll come back to that. It's a very
curious area and it has baffled people for a long time. And we really
do have to understand, Nonnus, before we can think about what he's
actually doing here. We know that he was born in a city called
Pineapple's to give you on the map here, the circle and sort of
central southern Egypt. He's born there, but he lived and worked in
Alexandria for most of his life. And we don't actually know much of
anything else about him and his life. He's probably writing in the
mid to late 5th century here. We know that he also wrote before he
wrote the Dionysiac, he also wrote something else called The
Paraphrase of the Gospel of Saint John. So this is a work of
Christian theology. This is a fairly common kind of writing at the
time, and what he's doing is he's taking the gospel of John from the
New Testament. And he is he's not making it into an epic, but he is.
Elevating the language and setting it to poetry, it's almost an epic,
almost a miniature epic, but not quite generally, just a long,
elaborate poem. And what he does in this paraphrase is he he writes
about the life of Saint John, but he writes about the life of Saint
John in a way that uses a lot of Christian theology that is not
floating around in texts at the time, but is floating around in in
Christian circles. Oh, sorry, Drew. I missed your comment. Dionysus,
being the son of Zeus could be an allegory for Jesus as the son of
the Christian God. Yes, actually, we're going to come back to that.
That is a that's a very good interpretation, because as a Christian,
he is referencing his own beliefs in what he's writing. And he's he's
doing this in a very nuanced way, so we know that he is a Christian
writer. We know that he's engaging with the with the early Christian
ideas in a way that is very nuanced and very educated, not what we
would expect a pagan author to do who is just ridiculing
Christianity. So we think that the paraphrase is him legitimately
writing about his beliefs and then he writes the Dionysiac later.
Now, there's no indication that he changed religions to conversions
from paganism to Christianity at this point in time are fairly
common. Conversions from Christianity to paganism are really rare in
the four hundreds. And so we really don't have any reason to suspect
that he's changing religions from Christianity to paganism. So when
he's writing this Dionysiac, we shouldn't think that he's writing it
as a pagan, as a devotional text. So there's this old idea that the
paraphrase was a tongue in cheek satire of Christianity in the
Dionysiac was was more reverent and reflective of late antique
paganism. But that's an old idea. Modern scholarship thinks more that
we should flip this. So the paraphrase is a reflection of early
Christian belief in the Dionysiac becomes a tongue in cheek satire of
these beliefs about paganism that were floating around at the time.
And I think with that idea, that idea of tongue in cheek satire, I
think that's how we have to approach book. Twenty five here. And we
have to understand that in the light of what else is happening, the
education system, I kind of talked about this with with proba to the
education system at the time, is very much still based on these old
classic texts by classic texts. I mean, like the Aeneid and the
Odyssey and the old Athenian dramas, the text books, the school books
that we have from this period, they're still based on these old
classic texts. And whether you're pagan or you're Christian, you're
still educated with the same stories, the same old old dramas, old
epics, old mythologies. We encounter this with Prometa. That's the
sound familiar references there. This is what we talked about with
Proba. The reason she's using Virgile to talk about to talk about
Christianity is because Virgile has this this cultural legacy, this
this cultural importance. And it's important to bridge that gap
between Virgile and in her religion. And Nonnus is doing the same. So
this jewelled style of literature where he's using all of these myths
as Jewelz in his in his epic, these the shiny, flashy, pretty things
that don't actually contribute much to the substance of the
narrative. It's very popular in. It works for Greek, too, but it
should be read in the sense of this this education system, this idea
of pulling in all of these different myths to show education, to show
culture. But it doesn't show belief. It's just something a little bit
different. So I. Again, if anything is unclear, just shout out. All
right, so the narrative is kind of hard to talk about because the
Dionysiac is by a wide margin, the longest epic that we have from the
ancient Mediterranean, from any culture, Greek, Roman, Egyptian,
Babylonian, anything Persian. It's forty eight books long, which
makes it twice as long as the Iliad or Odyssey, four times as long as
they need. In terms of book length, it's twenty thousand and a half
lines, which makes it much longer than the sixteen thousand line long
Iliad. So I'm not going to go through all of the various plot lines
in detail here. I'm just going to give you the barest outline. So the
first couple of books are an introduction to the text and a
description of the birth of the cosmos. We have this war against the
constellations themselves to create the the earth and and all of the
gods, which is kind of strange little story that's not paralleled in
many other places. After that, he goes on for the next several books
to talk about the ancestry and the foundation of Dionysus Homeland
that is the area in and around FTS. So a lot of these foundation
myths tie in to what we read about with with these older, dramatic
ideas about the seven against Thebes and and all of these ideas about
the destruction of the city and the rebirth and all of this. So this
is setting the stage to understand Thebes in which Dionysus will
later come to be. And so in the next set of four books here we get
the the birth of Dionysus. His father is Zus. His mother is a is a
mortal woman. And so when he is born, his mother dies. There's more
going on there. His mother asked to see Zus in all his glory. And
when Zeus does this, his mother burns, literally burns because the
lightning God is revealing himself to her. So she burns to death and
Zeus manages to save Dionysus from the from the fire. And so he this
tells about his birth, his tragic birth and his upbringing and
education and his adoption of grapevines, vines and wine in general
as his symbol. But he's not a God yet. He's he's half God. He's not
really a hero either. Not in the old mold. He's he's still mortal. He
is kind of a hero. But he doesn't really have the powers that that
other earlier heroes did. And he doesn't really want them either. He
doesn't want to be another Hercules or Perseus or Theseus. He wants
to be a God. And so he talks to Zus about this. And Zus agrees to to
give him the chance to become a God. And that's what we hear about in
the next section is the section books thirteen to forty that occupy
most of the epic we hear about dinosaurs accomplishments that allow
him to transition into being a God. Zus challenges him with this
series of of exploits of challenges, kind of like what Heracles did,
but in this case, a little bit different for dinosaurs. So Ziu says
that if you go off and conquer the Indians, it's nonspecific as to
which Indians or what city he's supposed to conquer here. But Zo says
that if you go off and do this Dionysius, then you can become a God
and you will belong with us here on Mount Olympus with the other
gods. And so this is what we hear about Dionysius doing for most of
the book. He goes off, he goes E he conquers the Indians with his
arm, army of mean to our female followers of Dionysus and his army of
Sayer's. And with this army of men and translators, he conquers India
and then comes back west with his army sort of wreaking a little bit
more destruction on the way. And eventually at the end of the epic,
we hear him returning to Greece, becoming a God, and we end with a
summary of his divine powers. Now, this is a long epic, it's very
long, it doesn't have the most obvious division like organizational
scheme, there's not really a good example of rank composition or some
of the other more obvious groupings into four or three book sections
like we've seen in the past. It's it's sort of hard to find an
organizational scheme. And I think the easiest way to explain this is
also the most likely there's something else at this time called a
royal encomium, which is it's not an epic. It's a it's a long poem
that is designed to take the life, the story of a really important
person's life, like a king or queen or an emperor, and make it into
something like an epic. And all of these royal encomium and cumins
have the exact same format. There's an introduction where they lay
out what they're going to talk about. They proceed to talk about the
ancestry of the person that they are writing the encomium for. Then
they talk about the birth and the education, the early exploits of
the person as a child. Then they talk about their accomplishments,
the things that make them worthy of memory for an epic telling. So
these accomplishments in war and peace and then at the very end, they
summarize the person's powers, their authority, their greatest
accomplishments, and ultimately their death or their transition into
divine status. And so this general outline follows pretty closely
with what we see with the Dionysiac. So I think we can we can think
of this as a royal encomium just made into a much, much longer,
grander epic in this jewel style that's designed to pull in all of
these other myths that don't necessarily have any obvious relation to
Dionysus, but he's pulling them all in in this jewelled fashion. Now,
if we look at book twenty five, this is the first book in that second
half, he wrote the first twenty four books. Then there's this break
book. Twenty four ends with the seven year pause of Dionysius Army
about to attack. Well, they've already attacked the Indians. Again,
we're not really clear on the geography or exactly where he is or who
he's attacking. They've paused that attack for seven years. And so
book twenty five picks up after that seven year pause with a new
invocation and a new resumption of the war. Now, before we talk about
the war itself and what's happening here, we have to remember that
this old this idea of dying ISIS as this rampaging army spreading his
godhood in front of him, this idea that's represented here in the
process of Baucus painting, that's not actually what's happening.
Right. As a Christian, he's writing something a little bit different.
He's writing about ISIS, but he's not actually talking about
diagnosis. So the book opens with the summary, just this first little
a couple lines in the twenty fifth book. Presumably you have the
struggle, you second person have the struggle of Perseus and the
comparison of Akeley's with the of ISIS. So this little summary is
something that we start to see very, very late in the late entry
period, the late Roman period where either Nonnus or someone else
much later has come through and given little summaries of the books
at the beginning, so that if you're looking for a specific set of
stories, you can thumb through and find just these little summaries
at the beginning and figure out, oh, you want to learn about Perseus
here? You come to this book and it's not actually part of the epic
itself. It's not even included in the line numbers. But this is this
is the point of the summary. And you can collect these different
summaries from the different books and create an encyclopedia entry
for the entire epic, which other compilers did. And then we have an
invitation to the news that is the singular news, we've seen this
before, the beginning of the Odyssey seem to be news of the much
troubled man. The man with the much turning mind seemed to me muse in
the singular. But this also kind of works for a Christian audience to
write the muse in the singular as opposed to muses in the plural.
It's a little bit easier to reconcile here, and we actually have a
couple of references to two different gods to which we'll come back
to a little bit later. Then he goes in to talk about the heroes of
old, which is all about why die in ISIS is great and awesome and
amazing because he's better than all of these other people. So we
hear about Perseus versus Medusa, Perseus going in and killing the
Gorgon Medusa and going off and having his other exploits. But
Perseus is not great for four reasons, and Dionysus is actually
better than Perseus, in spite of everything that Perseus dead. Then
we hear about Ni&ntilde;os going off and conquering the city of
missiles. We also hear about Scylla. This is the same Scilla from the
Odyssey that Odysseus has to sail his ships past. Menas did all of
these other things, but Dionysus is ultimately better than me also.
And we hear also about the labors of Hercules, which we've
encountered these ideas before, too. And in spite of everything that
Hercules did and all of the the different population groups that he
went around settling and creating, all of the cults and temples that
he founded or started the practice around, in spite of all of the
accomplishments of Pericles, Dionysus is actually better than he is
for these other reasons. So we get this these comparisons with these
heroes of old that always end up with the rationalization that
Dionysus is better for one reason or another. And then we get the
second invitation, the second series of implications after. So after
we've established that Dionysus is is great, then we get another set
of indications described before we talk about what Dionysus is doing
with his greatness. And here we have an invitation to Homer.
Curiously, the homer who was very much thought of as a mortal human
man at this point in time. So we are invoking the memory of Homer to
sing the song. And we also have an unknown goddess, which, again,
we've seen before the beginning of the Iliad is saying to me, goddess
of the terrible rage of Achilles, a goddess, is unnamed and invoked
here. So here in book twenty five, he's referencing both the
beginning of the Iliad and the beginning of The Odyssey. And Homer
himself, he's invoking all of these in order to tell the story of why
Dionysus is amazing. And he goes on to talk about Dionysus. After a
seven year pause, he restarts his war against King Darius and the the
Indians again, never specific as to where or what. And we hear some
conventions that we might expect. So Adam brings Dionysus divine
armor and ultimately orders from Zeus to resume the war and pick up
the pace. And if you're going to do this thing, just go ahead and do
it. This is the same as if you if you've ever heard of the the
goddess Kimeli or the Magna martyr in Rome, ATUS is her her
attendant. This is the same as here. And so this idea of bringing
armor we've seen before and this gets our armor brought to him,
Achilles gets armor brought to him now die in ISIS, its armor brought
to him. And so we have this this presentation of divine armor to a
mortal still and then a description of that armor. And the
description itself is much more involved than we've ever really seen
before. If you go back and look at the scenes where he gets his
armor, you see a description of it. Same with Achilles. There's even
an epic by Hesiod about the shield of Heraclitus, which is a much
more elaborate telling of much more elaborate description of this
divine shield that is presented to Heracles here. Nonnus is trying to
outdo those traditions. So within this description of armor, we hear
about a lot of other myths. We hear about Europa and the foundation
of Thebes. Again, Thebes being a city that is very important to
Dionysus. It's his favorite city. It's the first to accept his
worship as a God. So this is how the city was founded. But we we
don't get a coherent series of myths that tell a really coherent
story. We jump from the foundation of Thebes to Ganymede. And then
from there, we get this curious myth that tieless of millennia, this
myth is only preserved here and not us. It's a legit it's a myth from
Lydia, which is a region of modern day turkey. And we have no
reference to this anywhere else in all of of ancient literature, in
any language except here. And then we get this other jump from there
back in time through the gods and creation stories back to Reha here
associated with Kimeli as the mother of Zeus, hiding Zeus from his
father, Cronos, Cronos was the previous king of the gods. Well, an
earlier generation of gods, divine beings. And Chronos had one of
these prophecies where his son will will replace him. And so he eats
all of his children as soon as they're born. But here we actively
hide. Zus gives Chronos a stone wrapped in blankets instead, and
Cronos eats the stone thinking he's eating zus. And so we get this
reference to the story of the origins of Zoosk, which is related to
deny this being the king or being the father of Dionysus. It kind of
makes sense for it to be here. But none of these myths tell a story
that strings together in any larger sense. They're just individual
jewels that dot the narrative. These are the jewels and in his
jewelled style that just decorate it. They make it more interesting
to read or they make it more pretty. But there's not a whole lot of
substance here. It's just citing the myths, including them in here,
because he wants to include and there's really nothing more to it
than that. For the most part. So this is the narrative, it's kind of
meandering. Again, don't look too hard for for organization or
structure here, you won't find it, it's just pretty much set up for
why ISIS is great and then a lead into what ISIS is doing, because
the big the point of the action is going to actually come after book
twenty five. But let's look at what he's actually doing. Look at
this, this analysis here. So we look for a narrator's voice. We
actually kind of have one the very beginning that that summary intro,
those first two lines in the twenty fourth book in the twenty fifth
book, excuse me, you have the struggle of Perseus so that whoever is
writing this is addressing the reader very directly, even though it's
not technically part of the of the epic yet. But there is an
acknowledgement that the reader is in front of them. It's kind of a
throwback to this old style of narrator's voice. And we do have a lot
of implications. We have three invocations, which we would fully
expect to see that develop the narrator's character and personality
and voice. But they're they're odd. They're a little bit different.
And in a lot of ways, they go back to this this idiosyncratic
religion, the syncretism between the older beliefs and the newer
beliefs. We talked about this with with Proba. One of the reasons
that she's writing what she was writing is to combine the older
traditions and her new Christian faith. And we call this the
syncretism. That's what Nonnus is doing here, too, I think. So we
have the muse in the singular. The muse is is from Homer, but it also
works in a Christian context. You can we can refer you can think of
this divine inspiration from a Christian God as a muse, inspiring a
poet. And it makes it not sacrilegious because you're only really
thinking of one of them. Later on in the second invocation, we have
Homer referenced as an inspiration. The name of Homer's invoked, but
it's Homer described really in the language that you would use to
describe a saint, not a God more than an author, but less than a God,
more like a saint, an early Christian saint, as if he is the one who
is the patron saint of epics or the patron saint of the singer of
tales like this. And then we have the goddess a little bit later than
that, which is harder to to work into a Christian construct. It works
as a convention, just something that's not as needed to put in there.
Because he's following Homer, he references the muse as in The
Odyssey. He references Homer himself. Now he needs to reference the
Iliad to remove any any confusion a reader might have as to where his
source material is coming from. And so what we see throughout this
is, is this combining of different traditions is really where he's
he's drawing his authority to it's not just something that he's
working in to be fancy to to have this jewelled style just for the
sake of it. He's working all of this in to to establish his authority
to be an encyclopedia. It's like what we looked at in the Hellenistic
period when we looked at artists writing about astronomy or our
castanias writing about fish. Remember this idea of claiming
authority over a subject by just showing just how much you know about
that subject? You don't have to present it philosophically because
you you just know enough to be the authority on the subject. And so
that's kind of what he's claiming to do. He presents so many
different mythological stories in every single book throughout the
entire epic. He presents so many aspects of different learning. Here
we get a lot of references to astronomy and other places. You get a
lot of reference to geography or to agriculture. So there's so much
knowledge crammed into this that it makes it an encyclopedia in the
tradition of wisdom, literature, kind of. But here dressed up in a
little bit fancier guys. And so in claiming this authority as an
encyclopedia. We hear about how Dionysius is great because of all of
the other mythologies and and everything else, that is not as great.
So he's rejecting he's building up all of this body of knowledge so
that he can reject it in favor of Dionysus, which is kind of a
strange tack to take. And so that's that's where we see a lot of this
this language coming into play with the understanding of the modern
language is an issue in the translation. We do see this this dual
style with lots of descriptive language and adjectives and adverbs,
but it doesn't actually do a whole lot for the overall narrative. So
if you if you go back and look at it, there's rarely a character who
is named without an adjective being applied to that character name
where you have places and objects being used. They always have
adjectives that describe some quality of this person or place or
thing. Actions that are done almost always have adverbs attached to
them, lots of descriptive language, but it's not actually doing
anything for the narrative. And that's because the focus of
everything is on ISIS. It's supposed to be dressy, it's supposed to
be showy, but Dionysus is really the focus of everything. And so we
get all of these other stories and mythologies being tied in that
that are just there for show, really. So we hear about Perseus
Perseus killing the goose, then doing all the other things that made
him a hero. But it's all for his own selfish game, the way Nonnus
talks about it. He never led men into battle the way that Dionysus
does. And in a couple of books, well, in many books and book. Forty
seven, we hear about nine. ISIS eventually defeating Perseus in
battle. When ISIS returns to Greece and attacks the city of Argyles,
he will defeat Perseus in battle because Perseus is not really much
of a hero. He did everything for selfish gain. He's not a real hero
the way that Nonnus talks about him. We hear also about Menas who
conquered a city, won a war. But he did it because he was really
pretty, because the daughter of the king of this other city fell in
love with them, not because he's a great military leader. Contrast
that with how ISIS is conquering India, the way Nonnus talks about it
single handedly. Ignoring for the moment here the fact that he has
this army of Minot's insiders, but this contrast between Ni&ntilde;os
winning because he's just very pretty and Dionysius winning because
he's a really good general, it emphasizes Minos not being a very good
hero. Likewise with this hero par excellence of old Greece,
Heraclitus is not really a hero because all of the deeds that he did,
all of his labors there, they mostly deal with animals. He conquered
deer and bulls and other animals, whereas Dionysus conquers people.
And moreover, he he it's not him who's conquering people alone. He
has Minot's who are conquering these people. This this this army of
women who are defeating his enemies. This is some of Nonnus old Greek
misogyny coming out here. If the women are the ones who are defeating
these these enemies than the enemies themselves must be less than
that. Sorry, wrong, but. And so one of the other things that that's
important to recognize here is the influence of geography. Perseus is
a is the founder of a lot of these mythologies that have to do with
Argo's and central Greece. Minas is from Crete but has a lot of
importance in the islands of Greece. And Heraclitus is important
throughout southern Greece and also in the islands. And so by when
Nonnus rejects the importance of all of these other heroes, he's also
rejecting the foundation stories of a pretty significant chunk of old
Greek mythology of the old Greek cities and the old Greek societies
that that we would read about in Homer and Hesiod and and Apollonius,
for example. And so that's also tying into why Dionysius is amazing,
because it's not just that he has a better mythology and he has
better character traits, it's that he is better than all of this
other geography that is tied into. And so this this idea ties into
why these myths are also included. It is fairly encyclopedic. We have
myths from Homer. We have myths drawn from from Apollonius and other
earlier myths. Surfers, remember, we read The Myth of Perseus in
Apollonius when we looked at Hellenistic period, background,
literature and traditions. And he also pulls in non Greek myths that
obscure Lydian myth that he that he talks about there. And with all
of this, we have epithets and formulas again, but they're not really
doing anything. They're just part of that old style, the adjectives
and the adverbs that don't really contribute anything to the
narrative. They're just hanging on there to be to be more
interesting, to make the to make them jewels in his epic. And the
type scenes are really doing the same thing. So when the divine armor
is presented to tanon us, we we kind of see this being used in place
of an pharming scene. But it's as if Nonnus either didn't know or
didn't particularly care to really flesh that out and make it a
proper pharming scene. He's using it in a very different style just
to talk about the armor as a as a as a pretext to pull in some more
myths into his story. And so the focus is always on diagnosis, every
single thing that he talks about somehow routes back to diagnosis
always and consistently. And so it's worth thinking about what
Dionysius ISIS actually is doing, and he's certainly not like any of
the heroes from the old Greek myths. He's he's presented very
differently and not always in a very good light. If you think about
what kinds of character traits we see in ISIS representing, most of
us would not followed an ISIS across the street, let alone across the
known world, to the edges of what the Greeks thought of as the known
world to the borders of India. That's the epic travel that Dionysus
is taking here. But he's not a leader like we've ever seen before.
He's not a bad hero the way we saw Jason. Being indecisive, lacking
the courage and the virtues of the old heroes, that's what made Jason
a bad hero here within ISIS. He's fairly reprehensible. He's
impatient and boastful. He's openly disrespectful when ATIS brings
him his his divine armor. This gift, instead of being appreciative in
the way that Achilleas or any other Dionysius here, is is openly
disrespectful to add us to to the other gods. He's not a character
that you really want to do anything for, and he's actively
destructive to every person around him, to all of the people, to all
of the lands that he moves through. And he revels in this
destruction. He revels in the conquest and the bloodshed. And in
this, he he kind of should make us think back to Catullus, if you
remember when we when we started the Romans section of the class, we
read about Catullus and what he was saying about Theseus and ARIADNI,
and he's talking about how these old heroes from old or great
traditions, they leave a lot of human wreckage in their wake. And it
should make us pause and think about if these old heroes are actually
worth following anymore or if they should belong to a different age
and a different a different system of beliefs that doesn't really
have the same relevance for us. Today is not a system for an Catullus
this time as it did originally. And I think that's what Nonnus is
doing here, too, because Dionysius is not he's not a good leader. He
appears to be a good warrior. Just because Nonnus writes him that way
doesn't actually appear to do very much. And he's against a lot of
human wreckage is left in his wake, some of it intentional. A lot of
it not intentional. And he does some truly reprehensible things in
other books of the epic. There's a lot of a lot of killing,
unnecessary killing. We have a lot of massacres of civilian
populations. There's a lot of sexual assault and abuse that Dionysius
is responsible for, too. And even by Greek standards, even by the
standards of ancient Greek mythology, that is that this is
reprehensible behavior. This is behavior that an ancient Greek
audience would even have recognized is is too much. It's beyond what
is acceptable, which is an interesting observation to. And so when we
look at the social background, we have to think about that, you have
to think about how how Dionysius this is consistently described as
things that are in ways that are over the top. So we really kind of
have to ask if you actually believe in these old myths online. Thirty
three, he when he's talking about Perseus hopping up on top of
Pegasus, the flying horse. Not as openly questions that Perseus
really did fly or not, so we see in in the epic, in the epic itself,
in the way that he's describing these myths, that he probably doesn't
actually believe in them, which makes sense if he's Christian,
doesn't make sense at all if he's pagan writing this devotional work
to on ISIS. But it completely makes sense if he's Christian writing
about the world that Dionysus once occupied. We do get a lot of focus
on wine, which is important, lots of focus on wine, but perhaps to
excess to emphasize the excesses of Dionysus denies as being a god of
wine, a god of revelry and well drunken excess. This makes sense to
have a lot of focus on one. But he he amps this up again into realms
that are that are a little bit hard to understand and hard to
believe. So we get this. I do like the translation of no more pain as
a type of wine because this wine is used as medicine in a lot of
cases. Remember, there was a story of a blind man who pours red wine
into his eyes and suddenly he can see it's this miraculous medicine,
which is kind of a strange story. It's also completely antithetical
to everything that Greek medicine thought at this point in time. No
Greek doctor or philosopher at this point in time thought that wine
was a medicine. Where we do see wine and especially miraculous wine
is in discussions of the blood of Christ. I'll come back to that in a
second. And so throughout this, we don't see die in ISIS as a as a
sympathetic character at all, even by the standards, again, of Greek
myths, those terrible and reprehensible things that he and his
followers do, they're supposed to be reprehensible. I think what
we're seeing here is a is a tongue in cheek satire of these old pagan
beliefs, everything brought into brought together to somehow
reference diene ISIS in an encyclopedic way, but in a way that really
does not reflect well at all on those old pagan beliefs. And so this
idea of concentrating all of ancient myths into one single story
relates to something else that we've seen before, too. When Proba set
out to write this epic about the life of Jesus, the reason that she
did that, the reason that she chose Virgile and lines from Virgil's
different texts to talk about the life of Jesus is because she's
she's collecting all of the classical past symbolically into this new
version of world history that that she that was developing in her
day. And so US is doing the same thing with Diana. He's using this
basic storyline of Dionysus setting out from from Greece, going east
and coming back, going off to the edge of the world and then coming
back as a way of pulling in all of this ancient knowledge, all of
these ancient myths that still have cultural value in Greek society.
They're still taught in schools as a way of preserving this this
ancient these ancient customs and general cultural traditions. But
they're changing, and so he's using these this encyclopedic story
form of pulling all of these myths into this very basic storyline,
which itself is very symbolic. So when we look at an honest and the
life of Christ, we look at that early Christianity, we look at the
story of Dionysus here. We see some similar themes being reflected,
the spreading of true religion or civilization in the spreading of
Christianity and also Dionysus and the spread of his his
civilization. As his army marches, we see a lot of themes of death
and pictures of the afterlife and resurrection, literally what
happens after life and then also coming back from the dead into back
into the world and this importance of wine, which is really important
to Dionysus. It's probably not by accident that Nonnus used the God
of wine to talk about this story, because at the same time, we have a
lot of theological debates in early Christianity about what exactly
wine should represent in the sacrament. Does drinking wine in during
the sacrament represent just one? Is it symbolic of the blood of
Christ, of the sacrifice of Christ, or has it been ritually
substantiated into the blood of Christ that that is being dispensed
to to to worshippers? This is a big theological debate at the time in
the four hundreds here. And the use of wine for Dionysus here, I
think is referencing that theological debate as well. And so what we
see is this, this this very complicated series of stories that are
being combined into this much simpler narrative, Dionysius marches
east, comes back, becomes a God. It's this old idea of cultural
tradition and heritage. But it is it's presented in a way that is is
much simpler than all of the mythologies. And the stories would make
it seem like there's power in taking something that's very, very
complicated and condensing it into something that's a lot easier to
remember. It becomes a symbol of history and knowledge without having
to actually think about all of that history knowledge at the same
time, if that makes sense. So it makes sense. I don't see any charts,
so I assume we're all on board with that and that's OK. All right. So
all of this is also playing out against a lot of other authors who
are doing the same thing. Nonnus and Proba are effectively doing the
same thing. They're not trying to outdo one another. One of them is
not the epitome of Christian epic tradition and the other the epitome
of pagan epic tradition. They're all working within the same
tradition, the same ancient pagan past, somehow being reconciled into
a new Christian reality. In this late antique period, they're all
relying on the same important cultural themes to try and understand
this new cultural reality that they find themselves living in. And we
see this not just in Prova and Nonnus. We see this reflected in a lot
of the things that are written at the same time. Among which, the
thing that we're going to turn to next, so on Tuesday, we're going to
read something called the romance of Alexander or the Alexander
Romance because it directly ties into a lot of these same themes.
Now, I give you an illustration here. This is from a mosaic of you
can you can make out the the name here, Alexander Wrex, as in King
Alexander, who here is being lifted up on a chair flown by Griffin's
so that he can get a better look at the stars. This is not in any
history of Alexander the Conqueror. It's reflecting Alexander as he
was understood in the late 19th period and any audience member in
Alexandria, Egypt, the city named for Alexander, founded by
Alexander, who reads an epic about the God Dionysus going off to the
east, conquering India and then returning as a God, going off as a
man, conquering India and returning as a God. You have to think of
Alexander the Great in that context. Every ancient audience member
would have understood that there's some reference to Alexander the
Great there. It's it's, again, encoding this idea of culturally
relevant themes within a much simpler narrative. And it reflects this
idea, again, a preservation through change. So we're going to come
back to the all of these ideas of the period when we look at the
Alexander romance. On Tuesday or excuse me, on Thursday. All right,
so I flew through that significantly quicker than I thought I would.
It's hard to do this when I'm not in front of people specifically.
Are there any final questions? OK, I sincerely hope we will be in a
classroom on Thursday. I will let you know if you have any questions,
please let me know, otherwise I will post this this recording and see
you guys on Thursday. Thank you. It masks their back on Monday. OK,
thank you for letting me know, I'll check my email.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_walmv5qt0fto"></a>Statius Thebaid</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> OK, so today, stations for the last
book or last epic that we're going to talk about the Roman material
and it is kind of like Lukan, it's another kind of strange epic. What
you guys think of spacious. Has not received a whole lot of respect
or interest over the decades. But it's not the end of the stick to it
like one for one, one four they don't have once. But I remember back
when we read the same thing, it felt like it was going to. This
process starts off running as the accountability promises put back
into the or that the. So if you look at formulas like that, just like
super, we're just, uh, yeah, yeah, that's that's a good description.
It's a this kind of like a bunch of different sources and influences
is kind of mashed together. We don't know all of his life, but his
work is. Well, also, not that well, this is about the most that we
have out of its work, and it does show pretty varied influences in
form and style then. It is the medically pretty close to where we
left off in the last class talking about did you guys remember what
Lukan was was talking about with the first of what his main theme of
the whole thing was? So bad things are bad powers that in general,
the idea of having all power control by one person, that in general
is bad, but really just the whole theme of power is not a good thing.
If the negative all the power in society or all the power that epic
heroes have had, it doesn't really come to anything. It corrupts
entirely and it's always destructive. The pursuit of it at least is
always destructive. Now, Lincoln was living about a generation before
stations and it didn't really get better in that time period. And so
a lot of the the lack of interest in the SADAD relates to the lack of
interest in this time period in general, this time period between the
end of the Juliar Accordion's, the death of Nero, and then the
beginning of sort of golden age or Silver Age, at least for the Roman
Empire, a little bit later, after there's this lull in the middle
when status is living and writing. And so it's been said by people
who study Latin literature and African history that today it isn't
really about anything. And to some extent, that's kind of true,
doesn't really center on any of these major themes that we've talked
about. It doesn't deal with Roman history overtly. It's about Greek
history and Greek myths, but it doesn't really have anything to do
with Roman history. It's not about Roman politics overtly. It doesn't
have any relevance to Rome. It's not a patriotic epic like the
Aeneid. And it doesn't seem to be about much. But obviously he
wouldn't have written it if it wasn't about something. So we
shouldn't assume that it was literally about anything, we should
assume that it's something and what we know about Roman history, we
should assume it has something to do with politics. So break up into
groups now. Want you to think before we start. What is going on here,
the epic is ostensibly about a war against thieves now go through
some of the history in the background of that here in a second. But
based on what you've read, what do you think the epic is actually
about this idea of subtext palimpsest, what's on the surface? And
then there's what's floating underneath it. Think about what's
floating underneath this epic about Estevan war. What do you think is
actually going on here? Prekop, take about five minutes, talk amongst
yourselves. That's the only thing I really enjoy. I don't like it or
not, assuming that this is something that's going to be some
pronouncements about things that, in my opinion, amongst things like
that, happen to be the one or when you look at a.m. in the morning
after going through the same thing or something else, and we're
pretty well overall, I believe that's not how we want to take that
very controversial. It's very, very autocratic. Someone as much as
possible. This is just something that people who take all the up
situations like this, Britain, right in the middle of that, they feel
that is just General Maxwell Raines. Exactly what happened for us to
pull this off is what? Not. But the that that is not. In other words,
it's very clear that the. At. Both. So, you know, I mean, it's that I
try to work through the mechanics of that on a day, but the first
thing we have. All right, let's come back. Good. So what's so bad
about a lot of background, a lot of mythology, a lot of other stories
that we'll introduce you to go through them all. But what is this
about? They'll say, well. We discovered that the United States that
Los Angeles is involved, but not all. Now, now there's a very
different perception of what gods are and should do, and in some ways
what he's doing is taking what the Greeks thought, which is that
level playing field. But the gods are actual entities who do things
and have opinions and thoughts. And these kind of combining that with
the Roman world view, really strange sort of way, a way that neither
the Greeks or the Romans ever thought about. What else? Anyone think
it's not about anything? You don't want to go out on that limb. It is
about something what it's about is the Emperor Domitian and a lot of
politics here, there's this wall in the middle and by lull, I mean
it's a period of civil war, but there's a lull where not much is
happening, ethic wise or literature wise. And then when things
stabilize, the empire stabilizes. We find ourselves in the midst of a
different dynasty. Julio Claudine's are gone. They ended with Nero.
And what we have now is the Flavien dynasty. And this epic is about
that, but it's echoing very similar concerns with looking had just in
a different focus. So we'll come back to that. But this as the forbad
is about the war against these number, there were two epic cycles,
two major epic cycles. There's the of the epic cycle that we've
mostly been talking of war against Troy, that the Iliad and The
Odyssey are both a part of. But there was another epic cycle in the
ancient world that we just don't have anything left of. And it's this
it's the thievin cycle. So begins with us. This is where we hear
about an Oedipus meeting. The Sphinx, as in the illustration over
there, proves his worth to become a king eventually and marries into
a royal family of thieves and ultimately has children. Now, in the
Greek tradition here, there are two different ways that this can go.
One is the way that everyone knows where Antipas marries his mother
and has children with her. The other is actually where it's not
Jocasta mother Denarius. It's epigastric or Hestia, who is not his
mother or she's just the princess of thieves. And he marries into
that royal line, which means the first book there has nothing to do
with Oedipus. He's just a setup for everything else that happens. So
take your pick. One of them is obviously more famous. And that's the
the tradition that station uses will come back to that. But
immediately after that is the thing that and this is the one that was
most popular, most commonly referenced. We've seen references to this
in different epics up to this point. And this deals with Oedipus
Schiller, who has two sons and a number of daughters. The sons are
the focus of this event because when Oedipus dies, is banished or
just leaves depends on the tradition. He leaves his kingdom to his
two sons, both jointly to share the kingdom. So in alternating years,
they will be king, one is king and another is an exile. And the next
year they trade and then they trade and trade. And that happens
precisely one time before they figure out that they don't want to
share the kinship. One of them wants to be king and the other one is
in permanent exile. So war breaks out ultimately between them. They
both rally their allies, the one who is banished. And the name
actually changes depending on the tradition and the older sources
here. But whoever whichever one is, is banished, goes to another city
called Argo's rallies, his own set of heroes. And this is the seven
against the seven heroes leading an army from Argo's against the city
needs to put him back on the throne. Ultimately, it doesn't go so
well. They all die. And so there is another epic immediately after
this called the Opinionate, where ten years later, the sons of the
original seven return they attack Thebes, which is now ruled by the
son of the former king, now named in the later tradition. And these
children of the original seven six where their fathers could not end
up taking thieves, plunder it and then burn it to the ground. And
then there's yet another epic after this. After the destruction of
Thebes, we have OUTMAN, the son of one of the original heroes who
appears in what we read and alchemy on goes against his mother in
vengeance for betraying his father. So it's kind of like what we saw
in the other epic cycle about the Trojan War or the Trojan War goes,
Troy is destroyed. And then we have these other epics about other
heroes doing things. After that, the children of those other epics,
the legacy about to likeness the son of Odysseus. So we have this
other epic cycle. It's a very popular and art, very popular in other
media, but we just don't have much of it preserved in EPIC. In fact,
this is the only version that we have preserved in epic form. We have
fragments, but that's really it. Otherwise I'm not going to go
through all this. But we have lots of other adaptations and other
media, lots of art, which I give you here. This is this is tidiest.
The brains of the hero, very popular theme come back to that. But
it's it's just very poorly represented in the literature until
stages. And this is where the date is important, because for the
place to be written, these popular plays like the seven states, for
example, or the Insigne, those are written in Athens in the 5th
century B.C. And we've seen already how Lacanian drama is really
influential in what later traditions use, what later epic traditions
think the Mets should be about. And so for our earliest attestations,
the earliest popular adaptations of this myth that even we're
floating around to the world, to all the Athenian, that's kind of
significant, right? It means that what Spacious is drawing on is
largely an Athenian tradition, whether he interpreted it as such. And
then all of this other stuff is really poorly represented until very,
very late. So what we're reading, it's referencing this older
tradition, but we do have to understand it as Roman. His writing is
not a record of what the Greeks thought about this epic tradition.
He's writing a Roman work for Rome audience living in Italian from
France. It's a very unique spin on this earlier tradition. And we see
that when we look at what he said versus what the earlier tradition
is. I know this looks terrible, but the white text is the older
tradition. The blue is what stations adds them. OK, so all of this is
the forbad. If you want the older great tradition, just look at the
white text, blue again, spacious attic. So in all of these
traditions, Adama's has two sons named Polynices and a Tapley's.
That's actually not true in the very older text. But by this point,
it's it's Polynices. Nice, isn't it? And at the beginning of this
tradition, we always have editors leaving the throne and he wills the
throne to his two sons. Now, why he leaves is different, as I said by
this point, and blew their heads and made it so that Oedipus finds
himself, realizes that his wife is actually his mother and that his
sons are well, in the great tradition. It's religious. It's a problem
that he has children with his mother, right? So he takes his wife's
hairpins and blinds himself, just like we saw with the light blinding
with their. It's a fairly common thing. So he blinds himself in the
of certain stations. Is adding that in not because it's part of the
original tradition, but it's what everyone knows by this point in the
Roman period, everyone knows the story of Oedipus marrying his
mother, having children, and then blinding himself in shame and
running away from his kingdom. That's what his audience expects, even
if it's not what the original epic tradition had. So that's why
Estancia says that in here, and just like in every other tradition,
the brothers can't share. And so war breaks out, but stations
ultimately routes all of that back to a decision of the gods here.
Jupiter decides that thieves should be destroyed. Now, Jupiter, the
God of Thunder, the king of the gods, the cat, the patron deity of
the Roman Empire, the Roman people really isn't going to destroy
Thebes on his own. He could God of thunder and lightning. He can
level an entire city with lightning, literally. It happens in other
myths. He doesn't do that here, which is a very Roman way of looking
at the gods. The gods don't act in ways that overtly change the
course of entire cities and the nations. They contrive situations
that will bring those changes to pass. And Jupiter is not going to
destroy themselves, is going to come up with a way for thieves to be
destroyed. He's tired of the wickedness, tired of always having to
deal with these Stevens who don't honor the gods the way they should.
And so he's going to come up with a way to destroy the city when he
does this conflict with colonizes and. So Eteocles is reigning in in
Thebes in this power sharing arrangement, when Polynices, who is in
exile, realizes that he can't go home. So while in exile in the city
of Argo's ahead of Mafia these days, there are ghosts here, just the
small space of distance that we're dealing with here. So when thieves
rallies its allies, they're coming from right here. That's it. Argo's
the arrows are coming from right in there and that's it. We're not
looking at the Trojan War where allies are coming from all over the
world. This is more akin to the Aeneid, right, where the the allies
and the heroes are just two little pockets, right in central Italy.
That's what's happening here. It's a very small conflict that is
being aggrandized in the epic tradition. So Polynices in exile
marries into the royal family in the city where he's in exile in
August and through that marriage. This allows him to use the
resources of his new family to take back his own claim to the throne.
So he rallies this Arga, this this army of heroes from August, while
it typically America rallies the allies of Thebes. This happens in
both traditions, what happens next is Roman argy bargy sets out and
then they stop, they get as far as Nimia before their supplies run
out, they run out of water. Now, this is not far right. If you go to
Greece today, you go to Argo's, you set out after breakfast, you walk
north out of Argo's, follow the roads. You'll be in in about
lunchtime. This is not far. That's how far this grand army makes it
before they run into trouble. So this is not a well led expedition.
It's not well planned. There are lots of things falling through the
cracks here. And that's kind of important for the way the are to do
everything that they do. They stop there. This is a fairly minor
scene that that station is adding, but it occupies actually the
entirety of Book six and part of Book seven that you read. What they
do is they come into this town on the map and there's this child.
There's a lot of backstory, there's this child, NAFLD, who cannot
touch the ground, as for property, if he touches the ground,
something terrible will happen. So there's this nurse that is
assigned to hold the child always. She has never to put him down. The
heroes come up. They're out of water already. They ask her where they
can they can find water. She takes them to a well and then she puts
him down. She then some grass is over so that he won't actually touch
the ground. But she lays him on this grassy back here and then zooms
for reasons of prophecy, sends a snake to slither out of the ground
and brush by the child and dies. The heroes are so heartbroken that
their quest has caused the death of a Eltis that they stop and they
spend three years honoring NAFLD and this is the origin of the Nouman
games. And the main games were modeled on the Olympian, the old
ancient Olympic Games. This is one of the big four games around games
and all of the ancient Greece. So this origin story for the demand
games is just sort of inserted in here, takes up one twelfth of the
entire epic. That's what stations does break here. Doesn't really
seem to tie in to anything because once they leave in the morning and
eventually seven, what you guys read, they never go back. There's no
other reference to this. So we'll come back to explain why. Remember,
this time they stop there for three years doing this. So then book
seven, the part that you guys read the archives finally make it to
foods. They they start to attack the city. Oedipus, his mother,
sorry, mother, tries to intervene and make both sides understand
peace. She fails and so the war starts. So then we have the archives
beginning their war. And through the next several books, we hear that
the archives do not farewell. All of them die, possibly, except in
Damascus. The king of Argyle's maybe survives. It's unclear in the
different traditions, but all of them end up dying for the most part.
And then, however the traditions work out. The two princes did
apologize and end up killing each other in a duel. It's important
that they kill each other because bloodshed among family members is a
religious impiety, right? You don't do that. And so they kill each
other and piously. And this sets the stage for everything else that
happens after that, which is the throne passing to a guy named Creon.
Whoever Oedipus, his wife was, Jocasta Epic, Casta Epic Hestia,
whoever that is. Her brother is named Creon. He's the only member of
the royal family left living after all of this. And he becomes the
king and he forbids anyone to bury the archive dead, including
Polynices. Now, you guys have seen two journeys to the underworld.
What happens if if your body does not receive proper rites? Stick
around. You're not alone on this one. Stick around. Yeah, it's not a
pleasant afterlife, right? You can't fully pass on. You can't enjoy
any benefits of the afterlife. You just are stuck there on the banks
of the River Styx for eternity. So this is him forbidding anyone to
bury the dead. It, too, is an act of religious impiety and it brings
consequences. So in the original tradition, people go to Theseus, the
king of Athens, looking for help status and makes this the tradition
where it is the women of our Argos, that is the mothers and wives and
daughters of the heroes and the other soldiers who died. They are the
ones who are marching across country to go to Athens. Now, this is
not something that we would see in the old epic tradition, the old
Greek tradition, the women of Argo's taking it upon themselves to
make things right. This is a very Roman adaptation. So then we have
folks agreeing to the demands by the guy when he invades thieves
again, kills Crown and forces the debt to be buried. That's it.
That's the. Now, the audience would have fully recognized that at
this point we're going to jump the war, where the children of the
original heroes here who all die go back and destroy these officials.
This is the story. There are a lot of changes here. Stations are
taking a lot of liberties with the ancient with the older material,
which in his day was already ancient, was taking a lot of liberties
to modify things for a Roman audience for Roman purposes. Let's zoom
in on Book seven here and think about the narod. All right, so when
we start Book seven, the heroes are all not at all, not at least
they're not in August either. They're in the mail. Right. So what
happens? What gets them out of NameA? They suddenly realize that
they're on a mission. She says he doesn't like the fact that now it's
Jupiter, Jupiter to suddenly decides that things are taking too long.
All right. Suddenly, because it's been three years, right after three
years, he suddenly decides to intervene. So long time that number
three is significant. But it's also significant that he doesn't just
inspire the other guys to get up and go do something. He doesn't even
send Mercury to the bank, to the king of Argos to tell him to get up.
He sends Mercury to Mars. He's rousing the attention of Mars. Mars,
obviously, the god of war here, right, but it's interesting that for
three years, the god of war did not notice that any of this was
happening. It's not that Jupiter tells Mars to go into Jupiter, tells
Mars, hey, there's an army here and it's not doing anything. You
might want to take notice because Mars didn't notice. The gods are
not all knowing in this tradition. They don't know everything that's
happening. They need their attention to be shifted around. This is
not a great world view. This is a very Roman conception of how the
gods act. Mars has has his attention shifted over to the Army? He
realizes there's an army here. He decides to do what well, what he as
the God of war and chaos does, which is what? Appear in the dream and
tell them to move. Now, what does he do? Yeah, panic, fear, and
there's a reason these are capitalized because these are goddess's.
Well, one of the guys wants a. So don't reveal the others, their
deities, panic and fear. These these deities that follow Mars around,
they do his bidding. Mars rarely interacts with people directly. He
has these other deities who intercede on his behalf with humanity.
And so with panic and fear, he wants the archives up, reminds them
that they are soldiers, that they are heroes, and that they have
other things to do besides sitting here for three years. So they get
up and they march and they start marching. And it's at this point,
apparently, that the other gods realize that there is also a war
going on, because then we we shift to Mount Olympus, where the gods
are talking. Do you remember what's happening here? Who's talking?
You can't focus, right, focus is the equivalent of Dionysus, Baucus
is fond of the city of thieves. It was the first sip, the first major
city to adopt worship. Adam Baucus was actually not born, a guy who
was born a. Once the son was born a mortal effect and he attains God
through actions that you're actually going to read about next week,
next week. So when he became a god, Thebes is one of the first cities
to recognize him as a god and set up a cult center in a temple to
him. So he's fond of these things, asking zoos not to destroy his own
city, his favorite city. Does Jupiter agree? I said I wrote this
Jupiter not to start the Jupiter. Agree or not. It says that it's
commanded by state is not something like. It may not actually save.
Wait. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Jupiter himself, like we've read before, the
gods cannot escape, escape fate. What has been fated has to happen
and even the gods can't change that. So the most you can do is agree
for the time being. Things will not be destroyed yet. It's going to
happen. It has to happen. That's what the fates of decreased. But he
can put it off as long as possible, and that's what he tells us. And
Barcus takes what he can, because that's about all we have. That's
about all he can do. The gods cannot escape. So we have this this
little scene here. Does this remind you of anything? A God petition's
Jupiter, Jupiter, bound by fate, can't actually change what's about
to happen, but can put it off for a while as long as possible and
makes this promise because the God Sparkasse supplicate it come to
him needing something. Yeah, it's going to look one of the Eliot.
Right. That council saying their ZUS agrees to do something that is
going to change the course of the stage for everything else that's
about to happen because of this act of self-protection. So this is a
direct parallel with one of the all then we going back down to earth.
We're kind of playing loosely here with time and space, but we go
back to Earth with the rallying of the seven allies. So Theodore has
put out a call and they rally. And then we hear this battlefield
speech of sorts from Eteocles, king of thieves from the walls,
reminding them that it's the soldiers who have gathered both the
soldiers and the allied soldiers of their freedom and their virtue to
sound familiar. Battlefield speech, freedom, virtue based on the
ancients. Where have we seen this? Recently, in fact, yeah, basically
Pompey's speech, but in this case set in the mythological setting, so
please reminds them of their virtue and duty. And then there's this
bizarre thing that undercuts everything that he just said. Wonder if
anyone picked up on this. We haven't seen much from epic similes for
a while. Status doesn't really use them very negatively, but he does
hear. You remember how the seamans. Well, that's true. It's actually
after his speech. Yes, very much. Yeah, yeah, the soldiers are so
inspired that they leave their pen like sheep following around. This
is not an auspicious start. You don't want your soldiers to be
compared to sheep, because in everything else we've ever read, we've
seen sheep in epic assemblies before. They're always getting
slaughtered and they're getting killed by a lion or wolves or a
hunter. This is not a good simile. This is how spacious closes out
this rousing battlefield speech from the walls. So we know as the
audience that what it is the saying is do it's not going to end well
and then we switch. So the allies have rallied there in full
formation, in full armor below the walls of Thebes and the Argos
aren't actually there yet again, playing kind of loosely with time
and space. The archives are still marching. And so we zoom over to
them, marching through the night, through storms, through bad omens,
panic and fear, following them the entire way from the mad thieves.
The soldiers are terrified. They're shouting out, but they ignore all
of the signs of destruction, all of the signs of chaos, all of the
signs that they probably should not be doing this. And we've seen
this before, too. This is basically Caesar marching at the beginning
of the first day, not the part that you read, but the part that we
talked about last week. So this is modeling a lot of what he's doing
here on Luca. So the out the guys get to get to these, they set up
camp outside the walls, setting up a siege, and then we have Jocasta
and here she she leaves the walls. She leaves the safety, sneaks into
the green camp, sneaks into the yard and faces or tries to find her
son, face him. This effectively sets up a council crime scene
counsels before one side says something, the other side says
something else. And then there's a third party who tries to find
peace. Where have we seen this? The Elliott book won. Right, where
else have we seen it? Sonia Kumari Kumari Cycle, rather, the song of
Lycoming. Went to lots of counties, do these council scenes ever end
well, like does the voice of peace and reason and rationality ever
actually carry the day? Literally, never, ever. An epic thrashing and
reason never went out because what you need is a big conflict where
everybody dies. And that doesn't happen if the voice of reason wins.
So Jocasta tries to to to bring order and reason to the situation.
She tries to convince the other guys not to do this. She tries to
convince her son not to try and take the kingdom back, just let be
what has already happened. And of course, that doesn't happen.
Tidiest one of the other guy heroes. Does not allow this, he jumps
and presents the counter argument, and then instead of a voice of
reason here, now we have that Rennie's Irenaeus is not mortal, which
is a deity. She's like a fury. She's an avenging. If you do something
that angers the gods and Rennies and the other furies are the ones
that punish you. So Iranis is the one who comes down not as a voice
of reason, but she whips up and guarantees that an attack will
happen. It doesn't whip up people, doesn't whip up the soldiers.
Remember what happens. Dionysus has a chariot as he became a god in
the Far East and marched his way west to Greece. He picked up a
couple of tigers in India and in India, Hitchins, these tigers up to
a chariot as a tiger tiger effect of Iranis goes to these two tigers
and stirs them up with madness, not madness, insanity, but madness,
blind fury like the blind fury of Achilles. And she inspires that
kind of madness in the Tigers who leap out of the walls of seeds and
attack the archives. The archives are convinced that the Thebans have
set the Tigers against them. So they they come to two military
formations that kill the Tigers and they prepare to immediately
attack the walls of feet, not in any sort of orderly way, but just
improvise close formations. That means they come together fully armed
and they just run toward the walls and attack it. Marked by blind
violence, unthinking, blind, violent chaos, this is the battle that
we see unfold. Does that sound familiar? Find that chaos. Do we see
this in the early? You see it in the heroes like Achilles. We don't
see the armies doing this, but the armies are following their
leaders. They're doing what they do, primarily because Homer doesn't
really care about the average guy, so doesn't really describe what
happens. But what happens with armies, what we've seen armies
attacking in improvised positions without any sort of leadership or
strategy, or did we see that? Now, what I was thinking, but yeah,
actually, yeah, yeah, the Hittite army attacking blindly and then
Ramses doing what Ramses does as his own army runs away. More
recently, this is the battle for slightly in spite of all the
strategy that actually happened at the battle, the way Lukan
describes it, he describes the the different maneuvers by by Pompey
and Caesar. But all of his descriptions of the actual fighting are
completely without strategy. It's to armed mobs throwing themselves
at each other and killing each other until no one's left. That, too,
is what we have here. So, again, the influence of Lukan coming
through in stages in the midst of this event, the. At this moment of
Oresteia. You remember him on pyrolysis? He dies in the battle. How
does he die? It's a weird death, yeah, swallowed by the ground
somewhere else. As a seer, he is actually friends with Apollo, one of
the tigers that is unleashed from from Thebes attacks on Birrell's
chariot driver and kills him. And so Apollo himself comes down to
drive on the Aralsk chariot in the opening stages of this battle. And
while Apollo is driving, the earth is untouchable. He drives around
the battlefield, killing all the thieves in his path and then Apollo
God of prophecy turns down furious and reminds him that he is fated
to die here at this battle. Something else, being a sinner and
knowing that this has been coming for a long time, like Riese, Apollo
lightly steps off the chariot, sheds a few tears for his friend as
the ground opens up and I'll be or else which composed dignity just
drives right into the chasm and falls down into the underworld. We
never actually hear him die, he just falls into the underworld, the
ground closes up and as if nothing had ever happened, the two sides
continue to fight in spite of what has just happened. We would expect
them to be surprised at this, but it's as if nothing happens. And
that's it, that's the end of it's kind of a strange place to start to
stop. It's kind of a strange book, kind of a strange narrative in
general. So let's break it down. In terms of society, we heard about
the gods and it's a pretty big difference between what stations is
doing and what Lukan is doing, especially since what what station
stations is drawing on in large part is look and have rejected the
existence, the power, the utility, et cetera, of the gods themselves
stations is relying on it. So what picture do we see of the gods in
stations? They are more active actors. What else do we see them doing
or how do we see them doing? Are the same as the gods in the Iliad or
the Odyssey. Are there subtle differences? Well, they're more like
superheroes than like the old school, like the very thing is the
very. But there is no way that everyone else yeah, yeah, they they
have their flaws, but they are definitely not human. Is it a good
thing? I'm sorry to say, I like what he writes about the State of the
Union. Actually, it's all these. Oh, I left off where there was a
prophecy that thieves will be destroyed. Yeah, so he is actually
going along with that. Yeah, yeah. He's he's not backing. You can't I
mean, the Roman conception he can't take. Oh, is it a good thing when
the gods get involved like they are getting involved? Is the result a
positive thing for the defense is a positive for the markets, that
it's not a good thing when the gods get in, get too interest in
people? This is kind of the thing with the Greeks, too. Greek
religion, the gods set the stage, they level the playing field, and
it's up to humans to act on that field, to do the thing that they
need to do. If they succeed, that's great. If they don't, it's not
the gods fault. It's the mortals fault. With the Romans, it's a
little bit different. The gods do what they do off where they are.
The humans do what they do where they are. You keep the gods happy by
offering regular sacrifices and prayers and doing what you are
supposed to do because you don't actually want them to take notice
and you want the gods to notice what your city is doing or your
emperor or your empire. You don't want the gods to notice what
individual people are doing, because when the gods take a very close,
direct notice of what's happening, bad things usually happen. And we
get this the very beginning of the book. When Jupiter, after three
years, just suddenly turns his attention to the army as it sits in
the math. Even Atlas, what's holding up the earth on his shoulders,
feels the weight of his glare. The world literally shakes when Zus
turns his attention to it. So if the world is shaking, then the
people in the place where Xerces is drawing his attention are not
going to fare well. This is why the archive army is immediately after
this afflicted with Mars, not a peaceful God or God is coming to them
saying, hey, get up and move if you have a job to do. But it's Mars
sending fear and panic into the ranks. When the gods take notice, bad
things happen. We also see the guards not being Almelo. Remember,
Mars wasn't even paying attention. There's an army full of heroes
trying to destroy a city and Mars, the god of war literally had no
idea that this was happening. The gods are not all knowing. They're
not all powerful. They hang out where they are doing what they're
doing. And as long as people keep offering sacrifices, keep offering
honor, keep paying them respect, they don't take an interest in what
we're doing. That's a very Roman conception of what the divine world
is doing. And they're usually expressed as personifications, they
have personality to the extent that there is at least some character
development, but we never get the feel for what the gods are doing or
thinking or how they're feeling about a situation the way that we do
earlier, like in the old Greek epics in The Iliad or The Odyssey. So,
for example, Mars, we never really get a description of what he what
he looks like or what he's doing when when Mercury comes and brings
him the message of Jupiter. What is Mars doing? Like what armor is he
wearing? Homer would have gone into a description of Mars of areas,
armor or his weapons, something to to humanize it, to give him some
sort of visual image. That's how Homer would describe spaceships,
portrays him only really in the guise of conflict. His whole essence
has been distilled down to God of chaotic conflict. And that's how we
see Mars. Likewise, we have Jupiter, Jupiter, king of the gods,
patron of the Roman people. But he's also a storm God, God of storms
and thunder and lightning and rain. And so Jupiter is mercurial.
Wandering this way and that wherever his interests happened to take
him, and so he's prone to violent mood swings and fits of being
completely call one minute, and then suddenly after three years of
the army sitting there in the mayor, it has to get up a newly
violent, fixated anger that the heroes have done nothing. His mood is
very mercurial as a god of storms. What they can be completely calm
and sunny one minute and then you have a furious rainstorm with
thunder and lightning the next. This is how storms work sometimes.
This is how Jupiter works. And Baucus even notices this one for 150
for following when he's trying to convince Jupiter not to destroy
thieves. He calls Jupiter out on this. Jupiter dispenses justice to
everyone who he has a personal vested interest in. That is all of the
affairs and the children that he has. Those are the ones who benefit
from his justice most, according to Baucus. Everyone else Jupiter
just doesn't care about unless he takes that special interest and
even then bad things happen. This is the inconsistency that Baucus is
calling out. And in this this kind of. Perception of deities is being
reduced to some sort of essential quality here we have this affair
between love and war, between Venus and Mars. This is not something
that appears in earlier traditions, in earlier Greek traditions. But
somewhere in the Hellenistic and early Roman periods, we begin to
have this idea that love is an uncontrollable and at times
destructive force. War is an uncontrollable and destructive force. So
they must somehow be related. So that's where this idea of love and
war, the personifications of these cases, get together like in
Mesopotamia, and they are with the goddess of love and wars. Well,
I'll give you one thing, though, is this sort of like, I guess sort
of like the re-emergence of defense against conception and then they
become more murky again, because I know that like like the Greeks
outside of Sparta, like deliberately tried to separate the two, like
a separate activity from the more like Sparta had to come from Africa
and carrying out the war now and then the Romans sort of combined
those aspects in again, or at least part of it is then sort of like,
I guess, I guess reconceptualize in the hope that the Greeks did
differently. But then the results of their earlier it pops up
periodically throughout the Greek world because she has that aspect
on Cyprus, too, and then some of the Greek colonies and in northern
Africa and then Syria take that that Ishtar and forget where it comes
from in Libya. But there's a similar goddess in Libya as those
personification. So I don't know that it's a reemergence so much as.
I don't know the chronology would work out there, but I'm not sure
the Romans are really drawn to it in a literary philosophical sense,
more than a religious idea. But, yeah, I'm not sure about the
Hellenistic world. It's a good question to look into that. So the
gods are functioning in a very Roman sense, that's underlying a lot
of what else is happening here. So when the narrator begins to talk.
How does he reflect this very Roman world view? Do we hear the
narrator's voice at all in this? So yes, yes, we do, right. We have a
voice, we have a narrator's opinion because as we saw with Lukan,
this is the transition from where the narrator is just sort of a
generic person who is channeling the voice of the gods to becoming a
person, a voice that doesn't just tell us what happened, but is
actively shaping it with their own opinions. So this is what status
is doing, too. So when he is talking, he gives us this invocation,
not at the beginning of the book. I mean, this book seven, he doesn't
need an invocation with every book, but he gives us an invocation at
the beginning of the battle in which he marries. So he's marrying
these same ideas. He has the idea that the gods are relevant and
powerful and do things in that sense. He's departing from Luke. But
the themes that Luke and is dealing with, the themes of destruction,
power, those are still here. So he's mirroring that very
intentionally. And in the same way that Lukan kind of collapses time
and space with all these anachronisms is inserting people into the
battle that were never there. He's having speeches being given that
wouldn't have made sense at the time. He's using these things to
collapse. The gap of time between the events that he's describing and
his own day under Nero stations does the same thing with different
anachronisms, these things that are just out of place or out of time.
And so we hear about pipes being used in the Macedonian manner that
Macedonian armies in the Hellenistic period had these very long
pipes, very long spears that they would have used in ranks of like 20
guys deep, like a hedgehog marching into an enemy army. It's a very
effective way to fight until the Roman legions in the Roman legions
revealed that the Macedonian manner is has some drawbacks. So after
that time, the Macedonians did not fight that way anymore. So in of
Zonday, the Macedonian manner that he's describing is hundreds of
years old. No one has thought this fight for a long time. But it's
also not something that Homer would have recognized because that
style of fighting, that style of this very long spear is being used
in close formation. That's just it wasn't something that was done in
Homer's day and certainly wasn't something that was done before
Homer's day in the period of mythology and folklore that Homer was
referencing. So this is something that is used out of place, very
much out of place in every context. We also get combination's these
are all in the description of the allies of the Thebans comes because
this combination, one hero where he was carrying a shield made of
hide bullycide in the finest tradition of Homer. We have lots of
oxide shields in Homer, but he's also wearing chain mail, which was
completely unknown technologically in Homer's day. But it is
something that Roman armies would have worn. We have this idea of
Roman soldiers kind of looking like metal lobsters, the Llorca
segments to armor these large rings of plates that go around them.
That's why they did that. They had that kind of armor, but they also
wore a lot of chainmail. And it it's cheap and cheaper and easier to
produce. So this is something that a Roman our audience would have
recognized as both being Homeric and contemporary. We hear about the
running around and it's a side wheel chariot that is coming out from
the axles on both sides. Chariot are long, slightly curving swords
effectively like a side. The goal here isn't to drive up to the
battle, pull off to the side of the hero, jump out and. That's how
they fought in the Iliad. That's what we saw in the Iliad. And then
as soon as the Heroes duel is over, they jump back into the chariot
and drive off. And they just do that throughout the entire course of
the battle here with the side, the real chariots. The goal is to
charge straight at the enemy line. And then right before you hit the
infantry, you turn and you dig this side wheel as it spins into the
legs of the soldiers. As you pass, cut their legs off and opens up a
hole that your own army can pour into. Not something we hear about in
Homer at all. It's something that the Roman army, as it expanded
eastward, faced. This is something that the Persians used this as
something that was used in modern day Turkey against the Middle East,
the allies of Rome, something that British chariots had attached to
their wheels when the Roman army invaded Britain. So it's something
that is drawn from Roman military experience, not Homeric
predecessors and certainly not the Greek experience. And so
throughout all of this, we get this overlay of Roman culture and
experience onto the myth that he's describing. And this makes this
this time period that he's describing kind of blurry. It makes it
familiar to the audience while maintaining its mythic status. So it
effectively collapses all of this time, making it a little bit easier
for the audience to read into what he's saying, to take what he's
saying and read a political contemporary message into it, because
there's just enough that they can find familiar that lets them latch
onto that. That makes sense. So with language and performance.
Doesn't always come across, but this is actually a very good author.
Very good poet, the English. Well, he's hard to translate, which is
why sometimes it reads awkwardly, that's not the translator being a
bad translator that's styled and kind of hard to work with. Sometimes
it's his language is very dense. It's very, very poetic. And it
earned him renown in his own day. And later on, too. So we talked
about Virgil being very popular in later periods. Virgil, his poetry
and his descent into the underworld is why he is the guide through
the depths of hell and Dante Dante's Inferno, the next book that
Dante wrote, set in Purgatory Spacious is the guide. So he's modeling
himself or he is the guy because he's modeling himself on Virgil.
Everything that he's that he writes about mythology, you don't
actually need to know any of it because it's just ornamental, that's
part of its dense flowing style. But everything else is flowing from
Virgil. He focuses not on giving us this complete picture of
everything that's happening, focuses on giving us these these brief
little pictures that drive the narrative along. So Virgil focused on
these cinematic moments and he would describe those cinematic moments
really well. But then he'd leave a gap between those moments that he
was describing. And it's up to the audience to string them all
together and form a coherent picture of what's happening is writing
the same way he wants to mimic that that style of Virgil. And so we
get these briefness and we get lots of other things that aren't
actually ever explained when they are given me first gets up and
starts moving. We hear these brief little interjections, the shouts
from other soldiers expressing fear about what's happening. We have
no idea of them. It's never said they're unnamed characters, as if on
a stage someone is just shouting offstage. That's the vignette that
that station is giving us only the details that he thinks are
necessary, kind of like Virgil and in the sense he really wants to be
seen as as the next Virgil, the successor of Virgil. And he tells us
this on the at the very end of the book, at the very end of his epic,
where he says he's actually talking to the epic, the his narrative.
He ends the story about the war against thieves, and then he starts
to talk to the epic itself, to this this book that he's just written
and he says, Outliving your master. Will you be read by Song of
Thieves? Fame has eased your way. So I pray to you pray to the gods
that you live on after. I do. Is the implication there? But don't say
don't try to surpass the divine and yet follow it. Don't try to be
better than the you know, your place, and it is the national ethic,
don't try to to rival it, you won't succeed. So just shoot for second
place. And if you do that. Well, you will be read long after I'm
dead, that's what he's going for. He wants to be the successor. But
just like Virgil knew that he could not compete with Homer directly,
he didn't try to rewrite the Iliad or the Odyssey is modeling on that
following in that tradition status following in the traditional
version of this parallel. All right, let's look at the heroes. What
do we see of heroes? The Afghan army is led by seven of them. There
are other heroes and thieves. What marks them as heroes? The name of
the chariot this year is something else. Here he goes to speak
willingly, beautifully. He knows that this has to be done. It's been
clear that this has to be done and does it dignity for that being a
traditional, I guess, collection of most other heroes throughout
various aspects of being like, okay, this is what has to happen. So
I'll what have to identifying what has to be and just doing it
regardless of what what the consequences are that can be disastrous
or else driving himself into the underworld. But that's what has to
happen. So that's what he does. What else do we say? So what's
different about that? A different way of doing it. That's that's that
takes guts right there, walking or sneaking into the enemy camp so
that you can you can try to avert something that, you know is
disastrous. She, like the Birrell's, knows what she needs to do and
she's going to do it. And so we see some of these classic idealise.
Is classic heroic ideals that we've seen before from the from the
Iliad, from the Aeneid, these old ideas of what a hero should be, a
lot of them are expressed in the catalog of allies to 50 foreign
following. So we went off the rails. We have Jocasta and there's this
guy. Here's a really good kind of microcosm of the himself's who is
armored only on his chest where he feels no fear for his back. Like
any good classic Homeric hero, he faces the enemy. He doesn't turn
his back and run, so he only needs armor. On the front is the
shorthand for that whole heroic code that the old heroes had or
literally any epic ever. Bad things happen that you can't account
for. And if you don't plan for those bad things and and that's
something that the arc of heroes actually do. So these old ideals,
these old heroic virtue, are undercut entirely by that sheep simply
here are the heroes of all that have come to Thebes to help it out.
They arrange themselves below the walls to fight off the invaders
like sheep going to slaughter. That's effectively what's happening.
So these old heroic virtues that they're embodying, we know that
they're not actually going to do much, but they're not going to
amount to much. And facing them, the sheep are going to slaughter the
archives themselves. They know what they're going to do. They know
what they have to do and they're going to do it. But is it a good
idea? Do they ever have any reason to think that maybe they shouldn't
be doing what they're doing? You have doubts that, Carol. Would you
say three years more? Yeah, if you casually forgot about your mission
for three years, maybe you shouldn't do it when the gods themselves
as your marching, send you nightmares and conjure up rainstorms to
collapse mountains in your path, maybe don't do the thing that you're
doing right. The guys disregard all of this like Caesar marching
across the Rubicon, marching to attack Pompey. In the berzelia, he's
disregarding all of these elements. He disregards Roma herself,
telling him, turn back, don't do this. Our guys do the same. They
disregard all of these bad omens. They don't make the choices that
they should. They consistently make bad choices. They're motivated by
their honor, by their duty, at least what they understand that to be.
But they constantly make the wrong choice in doing it. And so this is
why all the heroes end up dying. And yet, even when they die, they
don't die, particularly heroic deaths. Or else is swallowed up by the
earth. It's the fulfillment of fate. And Apollo himself sheds tears
from the earth. So it's a noble death. But there could have been more
and more heroic way to die. No, Stephen. Zero. No, none of this even
army follow him down into the underworld. That would have been a very
Homeric way to die. You take as many of the enemy with you as you
can, but that's not how Birrell's dies. We have tidiest that guy who
eats his his enemies brain tidiest has his moment of Oresteia in a
later book and he kills everything in front of him. He scares his own
comrades, even with Hal, with his bloodlust. So he kills all the
Thielen's until this one hero from Steve stands up and kills him with
the spear, doesn't kill them outright. The mortally wounded gives
tidiest time to kill the guy who has just killed him. And as tidiest
lays there dying, he asks one of his comrades to bring him the head
of the guy who was killed him. Which happens is supposed to do that.
But that's what his friend does. Brings him as head tidiest, takes
the head while everyone is watching. And even the guy is Minerva has
come down to mourn the death of tidiest. So in front of the goddess
Minerva, he takes the head, cracks, open the skull and eats the
brains, and then he dies, eating the brains of his defeated enemy.
This is a sacrilege. Like, you don't desecrate the body of the dead.
You certainly don't crack the head open and cannibalism. And the
goddess Minerva herself is horrified by what he's doing, his heroic
actions undercut by what he's doing right there at the end, just like
be released his moment of Oresteia. He dies nobly, but it's unheroic.
He dies because he has to, not because he's doing anything really
particularly heroic. And then Campanelli, who is well, we've actually
met Covenant's before in the battle of Frogs', and he's mentioned as
the the poster child of hubris. Because in this battle, again, in the
later books, he has his own moment of our Steier chases the Thebans
up to the walls of their own city and climbs a ladder up to to try
and kill Mark and on the ladder, holding a shield above his head,
taking all of the arrows from the wall on his shield. He boasts to
his own comrades and to the gods above that not even Jupiter himself.
Good could stop his Oresteia and Jupiter ties with the lightning
bolt, kills them there on the spot in front of all of his men who are
demoralized and run away after this. So Kapinos moment of our CIA
supremacy on the battlefield in the truest manner, the old ethics,
and then undermined by the fact that one act at the end of their
holiday season is to one of them, the king of thieves, one of them
trying really hard to be the king of thieves. These brothers kill
each other. Everything that they're doing eventually doesn't matter
at all because of the way that they die ends up ensuring that their
own cause is destroyed. So all of these heroes die heroically and
underscore the last two there, they lie and bury, all of the archives
are eventually buried, so. The heroes, all of them. Is there a point
to being a hero? The stations seem to think that there's a point to
any of this. Just seems like they're more like pawns for sport, that
they're going through the motions, they know what has to be done, so
they do it. But that's as far as anyone ever thinks. And that's kind
of a theme throughout a lot of what stages is riding. And so we see
that in the literary background, like some other things that he's
doing here. We have counsels, a lot of references to the Iliad here,
but a lot of what he's doing is very subtly subverted. So Barcus and
Zus parallelled Illiad one church, but then Tidiest and Polynices,
this council, which is trying to convince Polynices pass on one side,
tidiest, is on the other. And then instead of a voice of reason, we
have the furies guaranteeing that battle happens. This old type scene
is subverted right there at the very end. Similarly, we have the
catalogue of allies, which is kind of actually a catalogue of
enemies. And it is this kind of competing catalog here where it's a
catalog of allies, that it's the allies of the Thebans, but we're
supposed to be rooting for the other guys. So what we're reading is
kind of a catalog of enemies. More characterization is given to the
enemies here than to the people that we're supposed to be following.
We're not told how they draw themselves up for battle. Instead, we're
told that they don't draw themselves up with any sort of strategies,
that the archives just throw themselves at the walls and that the
Xbox. And so this this catalog here is also kind of subverted. The
battlefield speech mentioned this before, right, rousing inspiration
of virtue, undercut by comparing them to sheep, and then the Oresteia
bumpy rouse is undercut by his kind of curiously unheroic death just
falls into the underworld, doesn't take anyone with them, doesn't die
heroically or even make a real speech on his on his way out the way
that we would expect with Homer. So all of these ideas are kind of
subverted, all the myths that spaceship's uses, and there are a lot
of them not going to go into all of them. They're very dense, but
they don't actually mean very much. With the exception of that that
little reference to sheep, you could skip all of the epic similes and
all of them analogical references and not really miss anything from
the narrative. They're just there as ornaments, but they're not
really necessary except for this aetiology going to Mangum's. I'll
come back to. His biggest influence isn't really on the mythology or
the tradition of the war itself. It's Luke. So our guy is ignoring
Romans is like Caesar, ignoring Romans, our guy is attacking in a
chaotic manner inspired by violence, is just like Caesar doing the
same. And then there's this general theme of brother fighting
brother, which is also parallel in the first in book seven of the
Vasili. When the two Roman armies are lined up facing each other, we
have family members picking each other out on opposite sides of the
field. This would be a great moment to have them talk to each other
in an epic tradition or have the battle maybe not happen at all, but
instead they're motivated by blood lust to kill each other, even
though their family members. This is the same thing that we see
happen here, Polynices, and it is our brothers killing each other in
a duel, ultimately meaning that nothing that has happened was worth
anything. Both of their causes fail. And so throughout all of this,
there's this general theme of a very feudal conflict that nothing
good can come from. It's not just this specific feudal conflict. It's
any conflict. This idea that no conflict matters, no war matters.
It's all the war itself and the causes for it are ultimately
counterproductive. Everyone dies usually on heroically, and however
anyone dies, it just sets the stage for more of the same. So all of
this that happens in the and the audience knows that there is another
epic after this, the beginning where it all happens again and the
children of these heroes who die here coming back and finally
destroying things. But even that's not the end of the story. There is
more after that. So all of this stuff that happens, it just sets the
stage for more, which sets the stage for more. And we see this in the
Latin itself. Toward the end of the book, the final book, we get this
phrase one Electrum below and then is implied because Latin does
that. It's a tricky language because literally it means nothing was
gained by this war here. But because Latin is Latin, it can do this.
It can also mean nothing is gained by war in general. Right there at
the very end, summing up the point of the entire epic that you've
just read. He says this was all pointless. Awkward, why would you
bother to do this at all? Sorry, it is about. Well, it's about what
comes from the war, which is nothing. So I guess just kind of didn't
put that together there to get from where Lukan wants to get to to
where status is at this point, we have to go back to history a little
bit. So narrow dies a few years after Lukken in 68. And from the
point of his death for a little over in the year. Sixty nine alone.
There are four of them. The last one of these is Vespasian, who has
the last guy standing becomes the new founder of the new dynasty, the
the Flavien dynasty. That's his family name. So there's the station,
his two sons. And then there's actually going to be a completely
different dynasty coming after that. So Vespasian is succeeded by one
of his sons named Titus, who reigns for three years and then is
succeeded by the mission, Titus's brother, who reigns for a rather
longer time. Now, the mission was never very fond of his brother. You
might not actually have been particularly fond of his father either.
And, well, he wasn't fond of most people. He slowly became more
paranoid, more destructive for himself and also of the people around
him. And as his paranoia grew, he began to order more summary
executions and banishments and become more erratic in his reign. And
I will pick up there, ran out of time about that. I'll pick up there
on Thursday. We'll learn why all of this had to do with the mission.
Look.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="_72t8qvt69u3t"></a>Proba Cento</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> OK, there we go. OK, so just real
quickly to finish up, look at substation's we left off talking about
his influence from look at the general themes of chaos and
destruction and death and fatalistic and everything. And this is what
it's kind of going for. And the reason it's historical. We have the
collapse of empires is the turmoil in the years after 9/11. Julie
Accordion's away the replaced with the Flavien dynasty, which is the
staging, and then Fleitas and then his brother Gestations other son
who is so paranoid. This is, I think, where we left off. Right. So
this is Domitian. This is the world that that station is writing in.
And he is writing under the under an emperor who is quite paranoid
about lots of things. And so we've seen how emperors try to shape
their propaganda actually using different emperors approach to the
idea of propaganda against us. Really happy to take his own
propaganda. That's the whole point behind Bertelsen and Augustus was
I mean, he obviously didn't write it, but he's very active in what
exactly that's the form of that propaganda. It's going to be the
contrast that with Nero, who was more than happy to have no idea what
Lincoln was writing about, as long as you can open it with an income
of Nero. And then Nero just kind of went in a different direction and
had no idea what was happening, which is why you could get away with
what he was saying for so long. Stationhouse had to be somewhere in
the middle. Domitian was very eager to forge his own propaganda
because of his paranoia. But he wasn't the best reader. He didn't
really read everything that happened. So when when Stations opens
with this this line of praise as you take up where your father left
off, what Rome selfishly wants is that you the eternal this is
sufficiently praiseworthy for the mission to say, OK, I like this.
It's that this isn't actually what happened. Right. There's the
mission. Didn't follow that stagings, Father. The mission followed
Tyas There's this entire emperor for three years between Vespasian
and Danishes. Now, remember I told you that the number three, as in
three years, is kind of significant. Number one, they are going to
army, sitting in the media doing absolutely nothing for no apparent
reason for three years. That's why for three years, the expedition is
on hold, waiting for divine favor to show it the way forward. For
three years, Rome is on hold, waiting for the great Domitian to show
it the way forward. This is this is how spacious it's kind of kissing
up to the mission, playing into that encomium idea so that the
mission will read this, be satisfied, and then turn his attention
somewhere else so that the spaceships can be very subtle about how he
subverts everything else. Does that make sense? All right. And what
he's doing is taking this theme, these themes that we've seen from
looking and working them in. So this idea of savage infighting being
stopped only by the appearance of Theseus can also be read as the
savage infighting of the civil wars in sixty nine, only being stopped
by Vespasian. But that didn't actually stop anything. It just led to
more of the same because it led to another unstable emperor Domitian
coming into power. Just as the intervention of Theseus didn't
actually stop anything at the end of this book, because there's an
entire other epic after this that tells what happens next. So these
things are being worked in. And from the very opening of the seabed,
we see this brother is crossing swords there kingdom by for fiendish
hatred. These things my mind turns to unfold are the brothers,
Polynices and the Net or the Domitian. And that's what he's writing
about. That's the the the dual meanings here that he's playing with.
And so we see right here at the the end of the early Roman period,
these themes coming about for Lincoln and stations, both of them
power is always destructive. The pursuit of power is always
destructive, not just to the person who is pursuing the power, but
for everyone they come in contact with the society at large. Power is
destructive. The gods barely act at all. But when they do itself is
always destructive and violence. There's no middle ground here.
People are either fine on their own or they're destroyed by
intervention of some higher power. Kings themselves amount to nothing
because everyone's motivation and then in mutual destruction anyway,
I think about all of these are going to die kind of pitiful deaths or
die the way that subverts all of the honor and glory that they gain
by doing something like eating someone's brains. Right. There's
there's a lot going on here that subverts all of these intentions.
And in every council seat ever in all of these epics, there is no
plot, no place for calming voices, no place to avert the dangers that
every single person sees coming. Everyone sees these disasters
coming. No one can do anything about it. It's very fatalistic. And
it's these are not uplifting epics. It's a very fatalistic view
because all of these same problems just keep happening over and over
again. Any questions about spacious? Yes, I was literally five
minutes from the other. Are there no other questions about status?
Let's move on to something completely different. The beginning of
Lazarevic late and now we left off with patience doesn't really get
better politically from that period. I mean, it kind of does. There
are plateaus of stability, but it just seems to be a cycle of
continual turmoil and unrest. And what Proba is writing is directly a
response to the results of some of that unrest. So this is the first
of the topics, the topic of the honest electricity that is the kento
Virgile and the Price Akintola is a very specific kind of literature
that we'll talk about. And all of the lines in the kento are drawn
from something that Virgile has written. So she's repurposing Virgile
to write about Christ. So want to think about that for a second. Is
riding for a time and a place and the culture that is very different
from what Virgil looks like, just like we had the Hellenistic period
being completely different from the old Greek epics that we wrote.
Let me read Apollonius had to write something different because the
old virtues that Homer had written about or sung about, they didn't
make sense and they weren't as culturally relevant as they once did.
So he had to do something different, probably finds himself in the
same position. She has to do something different because her world is
not the same thing that Virgil looked for. Her epic has to be about
something different because Virgil's epic, those old most Marum
virtues and values, they don't really fit anymore into the world of
Iliza. So how do you see her using and modifying the older epic
styles of Virgil or the Hellenistic styles or the Greek style? How do
you see her repurposing these these old epic formats and narratives
in general and then in detail? Do you see any places where she's
using lines or stories or phrases from Virgile to emphasize this new
world that she finds herself back? And if none of that makes sense,
don't worry, we'll talk about it. But break up into groups, take
about five minutes and think about that. Looks like. I just want to
know what you can if you also want to know the terms of what I'm
doing for more troops. So remember that also there's a lot of crime
in some which would make any permanent security personnel. Well, I
don't have a lot of time, I guess, just knowing that she was going to
steal and she didn't see how she was going to get that right. Right.
And of course, she had to use a lot of these people, not was and
stuff like that, where she has to it and just simply does a similar
thing for the. You see the to 190 there, that's the way the. Yeah. I
was trying to interject and move on to the next big. But. Not the
only. They also recognized that this is an interesting to. What was
it like when you simply say, yes, I'm sorry for what I did to you,
but I would see on to you know, it's different story. All right,
let's come back. Perhaps I should have left with this, but what do
you guys think? A very different style. See, one hand, I don't know
how I feel about her using. Virgil. Quotes pretty much completely,
because it could change the way I read it, because it I think it
would have had more oil in the Times when I said that less than mine,
that it's all better. But when I when I thought about it being from
Virgil, I'm trying to think where where all of these flights coming
from. And so it feels more disjointed because I'm thinking about the
disjointed context from which he's drawing lines instead of looking
at it as a whole. So I don't it's impressive that she did that. But I
think as a. And it's just the narrative on its own. It took away from
my experience of the whole story. This is this kind of storytelling.
It's it's actually related to a game that people would play banquets
where they would start with a line of Virgil or Homer or whatever,
and then someone would say a line and someone else would to follow
them with a different line. And sometimes you get the actual section
of the Indian and sometimes you go off on a tangent of just a made up
story using these lines. So this is kind of a formalized version of
that of that banquet game. Anyone else in. Yeah. Some things she's
more faithful with as a version that some of us might be more
familiar with another time, she makes some pretty significant changes
from some of the versions that we might be more familiar with. What
you guys find in terms of the epic style. What is she drawing?
Obviously, she's drawing up. But were there any themes or type scenes
or anything, any of these larger format elements that we've seen
before that jumped out at you guys? The implications to implications
and just for good measure, right? Yeah, those invocations themselves
are pretty limited to what she's doing with them. She's not appealing
to the Muses or or anything on pagan gods. It's the same sort of
invocation. It's a new God. What about specific stories from the
Indian, perhaps even sex is all over this, by the way, maybe you guys
find any of those references. We think that the earthquake animals
and the. The river where investment reactor starts and where it is
right before that. Yeah, yeah. That's not what I was going for, but
yeah. There are some others that will talk about what she does, but
as in where she pulls from the NEA or the Geologix, that all of her
work, where she pulls sometimes those the same that she's pulling
from ties in very nicely, it parallels the scene that she's
describing sometimes that actually kind of subverts it or contrasts
it and really kind of curious what we'll talk about that. But what
she's doing is reflecting this world that she that she's living in at
this time, which again, is not the world that recognized everyone
still calls themselves from it. But what it meant to be Roman was
something rather different, that the stuff that it almost felt like
she was. Believe it or the introduction of other kind of feel like
you talking of the sort of of thing, yeah. So in forget the date,
it's like three hundred. Some are the Emperor Julian, who is himself
pagan and is trying to suppress Christianity. And the empire forbids
Christians from teaching pagan literature in schools, which is
important when we remember that religion, Roman religion, Roman
religion and Roman society are not different things. Roman religion
is embedded within society so that what is a custom social custom is
also a religious custom. So if you are forbidding the teaching of
anything having to do with Roman mythology, you are also forbidding
the teaching of Roman culture or just basic customs, which means
effectively you can't teach anything. So his edict, Julian's edict
here is effectively preventing Christians from teaching children,
which he thinks hopes will promote a return to the old gods. And so
things like this are a way to to work in these older customs and
ideas in a sort of roundabout way, like you said. Yeah, it's it's
interesting the way that she's working all of these things together.
And when we get something that would be very. Well, yeah, not
exclusively, but I would think that she is selling the fact that.
There are some people who want nothing stupid, so traditionally it is
the first to be allowed to try to. Uses the word for like this. Yeah,
part of the culture that is being taught is is embedded within them
or has the Roman misogyny embedded in it. Yeah, it is worth noting
that one of her patrons was the emperor, so she can't save our
culture too much. Yeah, we'll come back to her life because that does
find its way to. Yeah, so the world in which she lives is directly
influencing what she's writing. And so so we're going to have to
record this session because it didn't work the last one. Just make
sure I am, in fact, recording. I am regretting that. All right. Sorry
about that. All right, so to understand our world, we need to catch
up because we've got a couple of hundred years of the future from
where we left off. So let me take five minutes here and give you guys
a crash course in two hundred years of history. I'm going to move
fast. I'm going to leave a ton of things out. So if anything is not
clear, please raise your hand. OK, so we left off with the mission.
Who in the United is assassinated because people really don't like
him. What follows is not a civil war. He's replaced by a different
dynasty called the Anthony dynasty. I'm not going to quiz you guys on
any of this. This is just historical context to help you guys bridge
the gap time here. He succeeded by a different dynasty, which is
another one of these golden Silver Age ages, the Roman Empire. But
when that Anthony dynasty falls in one night two, we had another year
of civil war and repeated emperors. This time five members, not just
four. And then that period, the civil war has a very brief Severan
dynasty that comes after it. But you'll notice one ninety three to
two thirty five. It's not a long period of rain and the seven dynasty
falls, things really fall apart. So this is the Roman Empire just
before everything falls apart. The different colors are different
countries or nationalities with the provinces, the administrative
districts of the Roman Empire. So it goes from this as one big,
unified, if slightly unstable empire into turmoil. With breakaway
kingdoms and what we call the third century crisis occupies most of
the century. We have a breakaway island kingdom and a empire of
science and the Roman Empire itself and very close to does not exist
anymore. So for most of the third century, the emperors in Rome are
trying to reconquer these two kingdoms. They eventually do, but it
takes them a while. And while all of that is happening, there are
lots of uprisings throughout what remains of the Roman Empire, not
just uprisings, but there are surfers trying to seize the power from
the emperors themselves. And to make matters worse, there's also a
climate shift. The climate of northern Germany gets a whole lot
colder and a whole lot drier at this point in time. The Rhine River
freezes solid. That's one of the stories go. And the German tries to
literally walk across the Rhine into German territory. You're seeing
the right of the river. This is the big freeze. And this happens for
a long period of time, which means that all of these German tribes
living in the north suddenly very cold and very dry. The agriculture
fails. They do to our agriculture is better, which is south, which is
the Roman Empire. So this is the beginning of the great German
migrations out of Europe and beginning to come down a part of France,
the Roman emperors who finally retake these breakaway kingdoms and
reestablish Roman control. Their solutions to deal with these German
migrations in particular, is to throw money at either to buy the
German Transource or to raise a lot of legions, fortify the cities in
order to try and repel the German migrations in a military sense.
What this means is that the Treasury, the Roman imperial treasury
collapses, the value of money collapses to the point where people in
Rome have trouble buying bread because the value of money is
basically nothing. And we actually see this in the coinage. It's kind
of interesting. Archaeologically, you can see the coinage going from
a really high percentage of silver right before all of this happens
to almost no silver at all. And it's almost entirely bronze, but they
still call it silver, the economic collapse throughout the empire.
And to make matters worse, probably because of the collapse of
agriculture. We also have the beginnings of play coming out of
Central Asia into the Mediterranean. We don't know what that it might
have been an early form of the conflict. We don't know. But all of
this together is it's coming at the exact same time for the better
part of a century. So it's easy to see if you're living in this time
period. It's not a stretch for you to think that the world is ending.
You have seen multiple series of turmoils and civil wars and now all
of this is happening. It would be very easy to think that the Roman
Empire itself is going to collapse and that all the all the
everything, you know, culturally and socially is just going to be
gone in a couple of generations. And that sense of change doesn't
really go away. The third century crisis here eventually stabilizes,
but what comes out of this period is not the same as what preceded
it. After the Roman Empire is reunited, there is this very real
concern about what do we do now? Part of the reason for the crisis in
the third century was because of internal instabilities. Everyone
agreed that the Roman Empire was too large to actually govern itself,
but no one really knew what to do about that. So what would the
numbers that divides the impact of the empire into four different
parts of Tetrarchy period? He made two primary numbers called
Augustus's, and then they would each have their secondary Caesar. So
we take one unstable empire and we effectively make four unstable
empires. This Tetrarchy arrangement of four power-sharing emperors
doesn't actually last very long before we get into a different
period. More turmoil, another couple civil wars. And when we finally
get another empire, just stabilizing the empire, he decides that the
empire is finally too large and he divide it into two portions among
his two sons. And this time the division is permanent. So what we end
up with is an empire in the west from Rome and an empire in the East
Room from Constantinople. Now, the Eastern Empire would become the
Byzantine Empire over the centuries. But at this point in time, it's
just two tumults. Everyone calls themselves Roman. Everyone shares
some version of the Roman Roman society and a cultural history,
mostly Greek. Speaking of the east, mostly Latin speaking in the
West, but otherwise everyone's just Roman. And so what comes out of
this period is a recognition that there's no going back. And so,
yeah, he had a long enough rule to stabilize everything. And once he
stabilized it, he put a lot of thought into how he dies. Things won't
go back, so that's when he came up with the long enough stabilizing
role to keep everything together and then irrevocably break up. So
three ninety five is when this breakout. So everyone recognizes at
the end of this period that there's no going back, there had been
this idea throughout a lot of history that things might be able to go
back looking and was trying to kill Nero because he and others in
that conspiracy thought that if they could just kill Nero, maybe the
republic could reassert itself and then everything could go back to
the way it was and everything could be great. Didn't work out that
way, but that was his hope. By this point, no one thinks that the
republic is gone for good. There have been too many civil wars, too
many empires being assassinated and simply replaced by. So now one
big circle back and the old virtues of lost my arm that were supposed
to come back and stabilize the decline of Roman society. That didn't
work either because all of this stuff ended up happening. So the
world has fundamentally changed and it's never going back to the way
it was. All of this is happening at the same time as the other major
force that is changing society time, that is Christianity.
Christianity has spread throughout the empire at this time. It goes
back and forth, being a dominant religion or a suppressed religion.
Ultimately, in the three hundreds, it is legalized and eventually
made the state religion during the century. This century is when she
is herself Christian, as is the rest of her family. And so she is
living through these changes. And as I said, it's not just the same
as adopting any religion because the religion is embedded into
society in Roman religion. And so changing religion means
fundamentally changing or accepting the idea of very deep existential
changes in the culture and in society. And so we have to understand
that is talking about change. This is one of the things that she's
talking about. And we have to understand also that there's no one
Christianity at this point of time. There are lots of different
Christianity, each of them ultimately agreeing on the basic facts,
but interpreting them in slightly different ways. There's no one
interpretation of the text or an idea because there isn't the text in
most of these cases where religion has spread through word of mouth
in most cases. And so this has allowed a lot of different
interpretations to spread. And so there are lots of different ideas
of what Christianity should be provides is one of them, but it is not
necessarily the one that is most accepted and it's not the only one
out there. Two hundred years in four minutes. Are there any
questions? Crash course in cultural background. OK, so let's look at
Tony. That's the problem. She is one of the while. She is a she. For
starters, she's one of the only women authors that we have whose work
has been preserved in its entirety. Now, she wrote other things that
we don't have at all. But the content here is one of the things that
we have in its entirety, unlike other famous poets like Sapho, whose
work exists primarily in fragments. Now, one of the reasons that hers
has survived is because of its popularity. She was a noble woman
whose family was about Roman nobility in the mid to late 4th century.
And so she was very well connected and she probably converted to
Christianity, as best we can tell, at some point during her life. And
at this point in time, there was this very common thing that people
did when they converted. They would write about their conversion.
This is called confessional literature. You wrote this confessional
as a way of expressing remorse for past errors, past errors as in
worshipping the rock gods. And so this confessional is a way of
proving that she has turned a new leaf and she is going to be doing
something differently from now on that is worshipping the God. But
also it serves as a as proof to the wider community that she is going
to be making this change. So the confessional is how we can tell and
based on reference that she makes, we have to face somewhere in the
middle hundreds. Now, this was popular. It was really very popular.
And it came to the attention of the emperor arkadiusz, who personally
requested a version of this from. And she copied it out and presented
it to him with a new preface that honored him and thanked him for his
interest in his magnificence, and that's the version that has
survived and so is the direct interest of the emperor that allowed
this to spread, because once the emperor expressed interest to
everyone else, the. So that's why we have it. So let's talk about the
kento. We tell an old form. But not in one totally new not in this
time period. Actually thought it was kind of a second class
literature, but we have seen this kind of thing before. The. What it
is, is every line or piece of a line is taken from something else
that is a direct quote of something else. And we've seen this before
actually in Hellenistic literature, or there's an author who wrote
something where every line was quoting something else, because
remember this. I'll point out that the final is not cumulative. It's
just over the Roman Atlantic, but it doesn't hurt to remember the
first half of the class, that one. Not the stars, but we read it the
same day. No, sorry, a couple of days later. The artist is here
thinking up artist and quote unquote, natural, that much of what
Montereau is writing is writing a. Work on the separating these
taking lines from The Odyssey is parodying them to play up this idea
of this elaborate feast that was so great that it's on par with the
great heroes of old that's parody. But this is this is what he's
doing. All of the lines, with the exception of the second line, are
coming from something of Homer's. This is exactly what was proposed
doing, but in a slightly more elaborate way. This is the best way I
can think to display this, her sources are pretty. She's drawing on
the idea. She's drawing on Virgil's other works, especially the
Georgia, which is wisdom literature. Effectively, it's in that vein.
And then she's also drawing on his other work, the because it's not
referenced here, but this is what she's doing. So this is a section
describing the beginning of the flood in Genesis. And you can see she
is working quite a lot of different references here. She rarely
references entire lines. She uses a lot of half lines, a lot of
fragments of lines, and she combines them in ways that may or may not
have actually been attended by by Virgil. That is the point that
Virgil was making with these lines may or may not actually look what
girl is doing. OK, so the kento has some rules. You can only use
individual lines or have lines, you can't quote entire sections.
Earlier about how the religious right people feel that it's time for
a Bible or Genesis like. So the Old Testament existed, whether she
had a copy or not, I'm not sure the stories were now because the
creation narratives are kind of fundamental to any religion, really.
The the text that would not have existed were almost the entirety of
the New Testament that would have come into existence much later,
because the testament is based on deeper texts that would have
existed in the Eastern Empire, whether it was common in the Western
Empire. I can't actually say such. She would have been quoting those
texts directly, either because they didn't exist yet or because they
would have been harder to find. That's. All right, so you cannot use
complete sections. Now, this is not the same thing as the Homeric
formulas, right? Homer could use half lines and repeat them to repeat
them. He can also repeat entire sections formulaically because that's
kind of the nature of epic at the time. So what Pro is doing is not
formulaic. That's not the goal here at all. She can use these lines,
but she can't really change them. Most she can do is make subtle
changes, small changes to the grammar change the subject of a verb
from singular, plural or change past tense to present tense or
something like that. Small changes to smooth everything out and make
it grammatically consistent. Otherwise, it has to be identical to
what was in the original. Now, as I said, the style of writing was
not particularly well regarded at the time, although it takes a lot
to do that because if you're quoting that densely, not only do you
have to have the text next to you on your table while you're writing
is out, you have to have probably memorized the entire Aeneid.
Georgia and the Georgian backlog's are not each as long as you need,
but you put them together and it's basically another and that's a lot
of text that she would have had to go through and memorized to know
where all of these lines are, which is deeply depressed. And so what
she's doing. The goal of this style is to not create original new
language or text, but to demonstrate cleverness, the cleverness of
how these stories are being reused and engaged with. Now, remember
this, because it's not just Proba and the kento style that are doing
this. Next week, when I read Nonis and his account of the life of
ISIS, he's doing the same thing, completely different styles. But he,
too, is going for a clever understanding of this older tradition, how
he's altering these older traditions. That's the point of what Nonis
is trying to do, OK? All right, so it's an epic about Jesus, this is
obvious, I assume you all got that. It's not subtle. She's not trying
to hide her narrative in the way that Kalinich might have been doing
it. She's trying to be overt because that's the point. But why,
Virgil? Why would she quote so heavily, exclusively, even from
Virgil? So or so, yeah, he brought the national level and everyone
has a coffee or has at least heard it, and an understanding of
Virgile is a way of demonstrating your Roman ness. Anything else?
Think about what Epic does just as a genre. What is the point of
epic? All the way back to the very beginning class. How does the
United. It transmits that story right. The common story transmitted
from one generation to the next. So where you are going to end, it
doesn't just tell a story, it transmits the story. It has to be
generational or rather intergenerational. It passes on cultural
knowledge from one generation to the next, the next. And if it does
nothing else, that's what it has to do. And so this is what we see
with the idea of Virgil. Virgil represents good Roman culture, good
language, but also culturally important things. A knowledge of Virgil
is important. Again, it defines what it means to be Roman, but it
also defines quality language, quality culture. This is culturally
important information. And so to transmit Virgil from one generation
to the next means that you're fulfilling this proper role and value.
The problem is that Virgil no longer means the same thing that it
once had. That culture has changed so fundamentally that it just
doesn't work anymore. And so that's where a problem comes that she's
trying to recontextualize this. This really important literature is
really important work of cultural value for a new audience, a new
Christian audience. But without the old pagan overlays that make
people, that would be her audience a little bit uncomfortable at the
time. So she's trying to to make that that that tradition and that
heritage accessible in a new way. For this reason, the is going to be
used as a school text probably was never intended to be used that
way, but it was copied enough times and over time became bound to
these volumes of classics that we read in Roman schools at the time.
And any questions about what she's doing? OK, so let's look at what
she's saying. So have the confessional invocations at the beginning
at these two indications, just for good measure. This is where she
outlines what she's she's turning away from the old users and turning
toward her new religion is only embracing it. And this is her
confession that she has done wrong in the past, but actually making
good on. We'll come back to some of the complications of that a
little bit later, and then where does she go after this? Well, let me
put this up. We don't start with Jesus. What you about as in the
title bailout, if it's Christy, but she starts with Genesis. So what
stories that you tell, some of the stories we get? Adam and Eve, what
about the creation? What else? These are the creation of Adam and Eve
get the fall of mankind. My life is hard to find. And then at the end
of this section here, she says, I shall leave the rest of history to
others were more knowledgeable about this subject than she is. Have
we seen any of these things before? Creation, the first people to
follow mankind. What have we seen creation stories before? Where have
we seen the origin of humans? The creation of people where? Or it
that we've seen the fall of mankind in the description of wildlife as
part and we have to toil and work, obviously, and we think of what
you mentioned. But, yeah, you're right. This is the this is the sole
survivor of that flood. And he's describing the narrative to all of
these ideas are still floating around in the eastern Mediterranean.
And these are the same ideas that are reflected in a lot of these
different epics. And she is taking these same ideas working here
because they're religiously significant. But they're also significant
in the context of this, the style of storytelling. She's choosing
these stories very intentional. That's why she cuts off there at the
end, leaving it to later on. She doesn't need to start at the very
beginning and trace all the way down to her, even though that is
something that that Roman Virgile didn't quite do that what you
needed. But he kind of starts with the origin story, the aetiology of
Rome and Romans and traces it forward through the descent into the
underworld. If this is a preview of what's going to come. So he's
kind of tracing all the way down any time. We have certainly started
at the beginning and went down to their own Roman epic is political
and historical, if nothing else. So she's fully within that
tradition, but she's breaking right there perhaps to make it a little
bit simpler and shorter. So after three hundred lines, she moves on
to the life of Christ. What stories do we get that. The line from
here. Berthon Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, so his his birth, his life.
Ultimately culminating with that baptism, basic overview of teaching
the travel and then ultimately the whole point of the religion being
the resurrection from the tomb, and so basic overview of his life.
And then at the end, because very few lines here in conclusion. All
right, so the six hundred names, like almost seven hundred lines,
that's roughly comparable to that of a very different tone, but it's
roughly comparable in length. So she's working within the Italian
kind of tradition here. It's not altogether different from the length
of work some days. Actually, what she organized it this way. Half the
epic has nothing to do with Jesus, which is ostensibly what she. And
while your inspection indicated the styles or it would have been.
We're told that he knew that. What if the entirety of the ecology of
the destruction, you kind of need all the background or so? Yeah,
yeah. So the first half sort of an ecology ecology have long,
illustrious traditions that. We've seen it in pretty much every. Is
there a way that she's using the aetiology that we've seen before?
What is providing that background do? It does explain why what what
followed is important, but it also does something else. Most of the
first portion there came from Hesiod YouthWorks and what he does
before he actually tells us how to run a farm. Why does he talk about
the fall of man we're talking about so we can talk about? Yeah,
exactly. All of this establishes the authority if we have this this
this concept, the life of Christ, that is so important that we need
to set the stage for half the epic, then there has to be a reason for
it. We have to establish that this is not just her understanding of
what what's going on, but that she has thought about it a lot. That's
what the purpose of the two invocation is to. She's really dedicated
to what she's now saying. She's gone astray in the past, but now
she's doing something that is fully committed or rather that she is
fully committed to. And she has done of it a lot, not just as a
casual observer, but as a philosopher. And so she's establishing her
authority by showing how much she knows not just about Abargil style,
but about the story itself, so that when she presents the message, we
know that she knows what she's talking so effectively, the exact same
set as easy, just in a different skin. Right, so she establishes her
ability so that the reader knows they can trust her and she is making
this very personal. She names herself in her in her invocations so
that we know, again, this isn't just her or her story, but this is
something that she has thought about and that she is presenting in a
personal way if we want to go talk to her about it. We can't because
we know who she is. She's not just an anonymous author. And if anyone
wants to follow her example, follow this this philosophy that she had
laid out, they can do that and they can feel assured that she has put
enough thought into this for it to be accurate. So that's where we
get these these two indications, that's the point of the two
indications, is that we also see something else and these indications
we see her turning away from the databases, which is to be expected
if she's a Christian, except she's also still a part of that world.
She describes herself as a Castalian Springs. Castalian Springs
actually has nothing to do with music, but it's a scream from the
side of a filthy in as in the oracle of Delfeayo up the hill and sort
of behind the mountain. Of from the site of the article and you get
this natural spring, and that's the Castalian Springs associated with
with Apollo and with the ability to be an oracle. So she is using
this as a way of saying that she is privy to this divine information
that the average average person might not be privy to. But she's
doing it in language that is itself part of that old world that she
is saying that she rejected. And why is she doing that? Make sure
that the point subtle. Why is she keeping a foot in both worlds? I
teach. Like I said, is one of the more vocal positions of the time,
if there's a word for that, know that word is pretty, take different
pieces of different religions and combine them with the other.
Syncretism. Syncretism, I'm going to pop the word up on the screen in
syncretism as we take different pieces of different religions or
philosophies and combine them together to get something that works
with both with all of them might not work entirely with any one, but
it combines them all into a workable puzzle. And that's effectively
what she's doing. She's taking these different cultural values,
combining them to something that works so that this new religion that
is coming in has a heritage, it has a cultural stand on. It's
effectively what she's doing here. And so the literary background,
perhaps not surprisingly, the Christian gospels and the Old Testament
and then also Virgil's Aeneid and a lot of the Geologix, but also his
backlog's. And then there's this very curious epilogue that Virgil
wrote. I for. Dekalog is about the birth of a child who will become
divin, not born, will become newborn and bring a new golden age of
peace and abundance to Tyronn. Now, the religious overtones here are
pretty obvious until we consider that Virgil lived well before the
birth of Christ, so he's not writing this to be a religious thing.
Honestly, we don't actually know what he wrote this about. It's
possible that he wrote this about this very brief marriage alliance
between Octavia and Marc Anthony. The hope was that they would have a
child who would be this golden child who would bring peace and
stability. That never happened. But maybe that's what he was writing
about. But it's very easy to see how early Christian philosophers
took that catalog and thought, this is obviously Jesus must mean that
Virgil had some idea that this was going to happen. Virgil, even
though he was pagan, must have had the special connection. Is the
only reason he could have known this was if God told him that, God
wouldn't have told him that unless Virgil had some special sex, which
everyone knows that he had a special status because he was the author
of The National Hero. And so we can see in the circular reasoning how
we're looking for that special connection with Virgil. Remember I
said that Virgil was an early Christian, thought of the origin of
this idea of a Christian afterlife because of the descent to the
underworld in the. Well, things like this helps the myth that special
status for Virgil. There was something else I wanted to say about
that. So, yeah, so long for their ties into this larger theme of of
the importance of Virgile, but we also see actually the guys had a
chance to read that. Let me ask you, there are some other older
literary tropes that are coming in here that are actually already
cover those. Now, I'm sorry we had to cover up. All right, so there
are some older epic tropes that are coming across there, all of them
find as easy as the general feel of Virgil, recast as the literature
which has been done before. Right. Frontal assault Geologix as wisdom
literature. But then we've seen with some literature to music. But
then there are other tropes that just tie in with the theme of what
so do this, trying to get this narrative of the future king who was
born and raised in secrets and become the full power when he. This is
every hero pepper in Greek and Roman. Pick one and it's on the is
Jason harassment suits with rage and secrecy. So this is every hero
ever. And now that this cult is being applied to Jesus, because
that's one of the things that culturally we expect a hero to be. And
she names. Jesus as the hero, the labels himself, so there's no
ambiguity about who the hero of this epic is. What we can kind of
debate is what is heroic qualities are so what qualities do we see
her give her hero? Some of these may be more obvious than others.
Wisdom, knowledge and wisdom. Thirty six minutes after the hour now,
both of them, especially secret knowledge and secret as befitting any
hero, they have the special connection to the divine, which allows
them to know things and see things that normal people can't or what
else. Time changes, Rob. Nelspruit or passiveness or. Bridging is the
people who are out. I. Yeah, given to peaceful stability as opposed
to to military virtue. Yeah, yeah, we see these old these old heroic
ideals that are still represented. We have, for example, this weird
line as Jesus is walking into Jerusalem. The people around him
admired the width of his shoulders, which is a bizarre thing, but
this is actually straight back to Homer. It's an often repeated
epithet of heroes that have broad shoulders. The implication being
there really must be brought back. So this is an old heroic idea in
this case. It comes from the Aeneid when it is in the underworld. He
sees the poet and he's asked who's in the Isle of the Blessed with
this old idea of the strong and powerful, but in this case, not using
that power to say we have this idea of faith coming in here, this
revelation from father to son, just like in, is revealing the future
to us. We have got to be like the future. And so this idea of faith
that most heroes, as we've seen, they're bound by the sense of duty
and fate. If they know what's going to happen, they have to do it. So
we see these old heroic virtues. But then we also see some of these
expectations being subverted, some of the ways that the qualities are
described, they don't quite match up with what she's drawing from,
what her source material is. So see, when he sees. I guess at one
point he's he's about to address a crowd, and when he sees that they
were crowded together and venturing to fight, he began, breathed with
words of divine love. Be advised to learn justice, help the tired,
each for his own sake, whatever wealth you have. It's about peace.
Pretty overtly, except. Tom Battlezone. All of these passages are
drawn from different sections of that, which is the polar opposite of
what she's actually using them to express. And this is something that
she does a lot. She plays with the source material so that she gets
conflicting messages or she gets supporting messages. Sometimes
you're supposed to get the reference and you're supposed to kind of
laugh at the inside joke. Other times she's using it to make you
think so. This is one good example. But if we look for other examples
where the original meaning doesn't actually match what's being said
and in her context, here we get this one, which I love. So the
temptation of Jesus by the serpent, the serpent being the embodiment
of everything that is evil and terrible. Right. This is the
embodiment of Satan here, confronting Jesus as the embodiment of
everything. Good, the serpent says. What is your birth home, the home
you come from? This is and that this is proper hospitality going all
the way back to Homer, but as said by the embodiment of evil. So
she's playing with this idea in a way that I think you're supposed to
kind of chuckle. Others are perhaps not as funny, but they they make
this this point, they underscore some of the things that are
happening. So God puts Adam to sleep and from from Adam's body, he
makes Eve. And so he puts out and to sleep. His eyes closed in sweet
sleep. Except this is a very common thing. Common way to say that
someone has died in the Aeneid or the Iliad. Someone's eyes are
closed and so sleep. It's not because they're going to sleep
peacefully. It's because they're dead on the battlefield usually. So
it's it's kind of subverting what she's saying about Adam here. Later
on, the serpent tempts Eve like an enemy. What great cowardice has
come upon your courage? Well, this is actually from another battle
scene where one hero is taunting another one in the Aeneid across the
battlefield. He's trying to get him to attack and do something
without thinking kind of ties into what's happening here, but in a
way that might be slightly unexpected. And then again, the crowd's
speaking with divine love and peace except drawn from conflict and
death. Other times it adds new layers of meaning. So, for example,
everything from the sex where God reveals Jesus is our kingdom. This
isn't something that happens in the Gospels. God, God, Jesus aside,
shows them the whole world and reveals that this will be his his
earthly kingdom. It doesn't happen every step this way because all of
it is drawn from the Iliad, where entices reveals to his future
everyone that he sees, everyone that he sees walking into that portal
to be reborn in the world is going to be a Roman is going to bring in
this glorious future that the has been fated to bring. And this is
the parallel that she's going in with this revelation of the earthly
kingdom here. Later on, Jesus rejects the serpent, the serpent
temptation, and the snake pressed its forehead to the earth and
forced bloody froth from its mouth. This is how he die or actually
not help Eurostep. This is how the people that heroes kill die in
battles all the way back to the heart. This emphasizes the defeat of
what has just happened or not. The disease, the magnitude of what has
just happened. The defeat of the serpent is taking on these heavy
religious overtones emphasized by the phrase here later on when Jesus
walks out of his tomb and the Earth encouraged to tremble at the
striking of its feet. This is from the very, very end of the year
when the US Army marches out to march the final battle. And as they
march, they are so encouraged, so enthusiastic about the battle that
their feet stomp in unison and make clear this is a very military
picture that is being conveyed here. It's not just Jesus walking out.
It's to it's the conquest of the old world by what Jesus walking out
of the tomb represents that's tying into the message. So we can see
how she's using these symbols, the very subtle cues to sort of cue in
the audience if they're paying attention, if they know they're
they're virgile, they can pick up on some of these more subtle. And
so all of that ties into how she's describing the good behavior, bad
behavior, it's obviously a moral text. She's drawing on moral
qualities, but she's also playing that up with the heroic qualities
as well. And then we get the syncretism right. You're wondering how
to spell the word syncretism, as in the blending of these different
religions, because she cannot reject everything that has come before.
She has to tie what she is saying in to what has come before. It's
important to demonstrate her Romanesque and tied into the Roman ness
of the audience. And so we get the rejection of the muses and
paganism, but still referencing things that are culturally important
that her audience would have recognized, like the Castalian Springs
and Tartarus and Arabize which don't exist in a Christian afterlife.
But you have to reference those because they have cultural values,
they have meaning still in the society. And then in the in all of
this vein, we have some very subtle changes to the Christian source
material as well. So, again, God showing Jesus his future kingdom,
it's it's not quite there in the Gospels, but we get this like a
rule. Your people with authority drawn from the Aeneid, it has to be
there because it ties into what the Romans still thought their
destiny to be and then going in line with with tailoring the source
material to a relevant audience. We get the Romans completely removed
from the narrative of crucifixion, Jesus being led to the cross and
condemned to death by the Roman governor. That's all she has to
remind Romans, because herself as a Roman noble woman, she can't
implicate herself or the Roman Empire in any way with what has
happened here. So she removes this this idea. And it's not
sacrilegious to change this because there's no text. All of this is
an oral tradition that's come out orally being transmitted from one
generation to the next to the next at different people are converted.
And so without a text, she is going on the stories that everyone
knows she's playing on the source material in a way that makes sense
to her audience. And we have this idea today that the text is
inviolable, but that that idea simply did not exist at the time. So
that's what she's doing and again, not to beat a dead horse, but all
of this is because the world in which she lived is completely
unrecognizable at the time. The same reason that Apollonius couldn't
rely on Holmer, the same reason you couldn't just take Homer and read
it, which is because his world was so fundamentally different from
what Homer was writing about and what Homer was writing for. The same
is true here. The world in which they lived was unrecognizable or
would have recognized the empire that Augustus brought in, which is
the almost Mindoro virtues that he tried to institute as a way to
stabilize the empire catastrophically. And so it just didn't make
sense to keep those virtues as first and foremost and in this
society. So they had to be. Any questions? All right, keep this idea
in mind what these ideas and mine, because what you're going to read
for Tuesday literalness and his Dionysiac, he is also taking old
stories and reinventing in creative ways. But he himself, as he
writes about style and ISIS, and that is the apotheosis of ISIS, he
himself as Christian. So I'm not going to say anymore, but I want you
to keep that in mind as you read the Dionysiac. I also want to say
there is precisely one translation into English of the Dionysiac, and
it was made in nineteen forty four. There are some things in it that
are offensive and objectionable. We will talk about that. I'm not
saying that. Well, I'm saying that because I don't want anyone to be
blindsided. So just keep that in mind as we read article.</p>

<h3 class="western"><a name="_ed1lb1y9ifj6"></a>Lucan Pharsalia 7</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> All right, so today we're going to
talk about looking rather different, kind of epic, what you guys
think of. So, you know, I like looking a lot, I think it's
underrated. A lot of people want to scholars for the last century
have absolutely hated it. And I think it's because they're comparing
Lincoln to Virgil. They're looking for deeper narratives. They're
looking for deeper connections and meanings. And it's not there. It's
it's written for a very, very different purpose. But I think it's
underrated. I kind of like it. So I want us to think about that
deeper purpose to start with. It is a pretty big departure from what
we've been reading. The style is very different. Lukin wrote the
entire thing as if it were a history text, not as in like an epic
about history. He's using some of these things. We talked about that
with Virgil. He's writing it with the language that is normally used
for historiography. He's not using a whole lot of epic conventions
that Virgil was using. He's not playing with all of the the
references to other works of literature. He's not playing with
references to other books in his own epic, The Way The Virgil did.
He's not playing with subtext. So he's he's trying to be something
very different and he's writing about a subject that's very, very
different. So what do you think that subjects actually is writing
about a battle? But why is he writing about about? If you break up
and talk about that. There is a point where people I know I was
walking by the United States. I remember in the 80s. I remember
something this. So I was wondering, but I was going to let it go.
What do you think about what? Did I do? Something like that. I like
this one, if you like, this one just seems like such a thing. I mean,
just like the picture on the wall, it's like this one, which is
about. So what we're saying, and there's a lot more to talk about
this right now, we're going to show you that not that one line was
necessarily being very closely watched, something like that, but. So
how do you about five or six, I think, with the addition of Cicero's,
even three to one senator, and that's the only one that seems like it
also seems like it's very strange. I wonder if see, some of the
things that they are going through is fine. But like a lot of things
on slowing down for a long time are that quick unless the government
can or should I say it's not happening. And it's really how that it
was And some of images the that I think it's also important to repeat
this year where there is a very clear message that something like
that are needed. I just want to got a set of results and I want to
make sure they don't agree with other. All right. Let's come back.
All right. Perhaps I should have left with Lukan was writing under
the reign of the Emperor Nero, who executed it well and made him
commit suicide during his writing of this epic, if that helps any
interpretations. So what is the point? Why why is he writing? What's
the message here? Anti civil war and serialism and therefore there
are still plenty of flying, so probably correct. I can honestly say
that. Yeah, yeah, it is a not so veiled criticism of the emperor and
of everything that the emperor stands for, but also. See, everyone's
in agreement. All right. I wonder if that's the angle. I wonder if
part of that is sort of like looking at some of the things that he
said whenever he became emperor. He didn't really engage in too many,
like major invasions of other tribes in the area and instead focus a
lot more on defending the borders and that sort of thing. And I
wonder if in a way, this is sort of like a criticism of the leader,
like to engage in wars and things of that nature, sort of saying,
know, I don't particularly like any of you, but at least in pointless
wars and relatively peaceful. In a way, yeah, although I think
Lincoln would have loved Augustus in with that to sort of a guilt by
association with Caesar, nobody has mentioned the Julio clients and
show you this one second. Anyway, this is the family tree of Julio.
This is part of the family of Julius Caesar jillions. And because the
emperor stepped down Caligula and then back up Claudius and then down
to Claudius, there is why they're called the Julio clients. Those are
the emperors and their more immediate family. And these are the ones
who did not die naturally. It's almost all of them. Not all of them
were murdered. A lot of them some of them died in battle. But this
was a lot of infighting. It's a lot of chaos. It's not the picture of
stability that a lot of the Julio Claudie members wanted to portray
outwardly. It's worth noting that a lot of Roman emperors did not die
naturally, but usually not quite in this degree. And remember when we
talked about Virgil, what Augustus wanted is to restore those old
virtues, right. The most modern virtues to try and bring order to
this chaos that had sort of consumed the late republic. So if this is
what happened to the Julio Claudius, what was the point of all that
was the point of all of these moral reforms and efforts to legalize
the most memorable and to bring them back into the society? This is
the social context that that Lukan is growing up in, that his family
is living through. We are skipping a few generations from where we
were to where we are now. And it's important to note that we can
perhaps by virtue of being born out of one of the provinces, he has
some distance from all of this that's happening in Rome and Spain at
a point when the empire is very firmly established. There's no no
delusions anymore that the republic might come back on its own. There
was always that hope by a lot of senatorial families. But I guess
this came to power that just maybe he's bringing this order and then
when he dies in his will, he'll bring back the republic. Some people
hoped that they wrote about it, at least, but by this point in thirty
nine C, E, I, this has been dead and for a long time and there's
really no chance that that's going to happen. And when Lukken is
built, he's gaining fame under the influence of the year 60. And this
is when he's gaining fame as an author. So he has some some poetic
skill that was recognized at his time and he begins his epic, this
the first with an encomium Tornero sort of kissing up to Nero. But
very quickly, because of what what else he's writing after that
encomium is falling out of favor with Nero. And it's not just him.
It's a lot of his family members to a lot of them have this idea that
Nero comes to power. He might actually be able to rule as a
philosopher king. Sounds kind of strange from our perspective now,
but this was the hope at the time he was raised with a lot of
philosophers around him as his teachers. And there was this very real
hope that he might be the one who can stop this. At the time. That
didn't last very long, only last a few years. And so once it became
obvious to everyone around him what Nero was actually like, there was
this plan that it's only a conspiracy. This guy named KeIso rallied a
bunch of other noblemen to get the other patrician's senatorial
senatorial families to try and kill Nero. And one of these families
was Lukins. Its uncle Seneca was one of the ringleaders of this very
strongly implicated in what's called the ring, which strongly
implicated in this conspiracy. And Lukan was also this is why the
Vasilios unfinished. He was implicated in this conspiracy brought
before Nero himself and basically ordered to commit suicide or die, a
very gruesome execution, suicide. And so very little is known about
those last few days of him. What we have we glean from the Vasilyev
and what he's saying about Nero through the person of Julius Caesar.
So the this is what we call it today, because the parcelling is the
battle, that is the climax of the epic, it's what you guys read
excuse me for saying Facilites is the name of the battle. That's the
climax in Latin. It was known as the battle committee as then on the
Civil War. That's what our historical title, a lot of history is at
this time. Start with the word day there. It means on. So he's giving
it a title that sounds very historical. It sounds like it's a
historical chronicle of what actually happened, not the propaganda
that Augustus and the other Julio Accordion's have been putting out
in Lukins interpretation, but rather he is going to be telling the
true history in epic form because everyone in his day. Was not
particularly happy with the Julia flights, some people were very
unhappy as for the conspiracy, but you had to be very careful because
if he's writing history, claiming to write history, this is not
actually ancient history. We see in Roman history as epic before it's
really common. It's the point of Roman epic. It's usually set further
back in time from wherever the author is. This is not actually that
long ago. There are people still alive when. When Lincoln was writing
this, who might not remember Caesar's civil war, but they would have
they would have grown up with these stories from first hand accounts.
It is something that everybody would have known about, which means
that when Lukan changes the history periodically and I heard this
come up in a couple of groups, when he changes the history, every
single person in his audience would have recognized that he's
changing something. Everyone would have tried to figure out why he's
changing something. So I heard a group say that Cicero was not
involved in the battle. That's right. Cicero is never even at for
ourselves, but he's in the epic is in the epic for a reason. So he's
not drawing on specific earlier traditions so much as treating what
everyone already knows about their own very recent history as an epic
with epic form. And so to understand that, we have to understand what
the epic sorry, what that history actually is. So we have to start
with the first triumvirate. Give you the dates here. This is a power
sharing arrangement between Julius Caesar, Pompey, Magnus, Pompey,
the Great and a guy named Crassest. And it doesn't work all that
well, it's awkward throughout its history, and it crumbles when
crisis marches off to party and gets himself killed and then Pompey
and Caesar have a falling out. Caesar at one point marries his
daughter to Pompey in an attempt to seal the peace between their two
families and when his daughter dies. The last of these bonds that
held this power sharing arrangement together is gone. And so this is
what causes the outbreak of the civil wars. And I said in an earlier
class that there are three major civil wars that into the republic.
That's true to a point. There are three major civil wars. I highlight
them here and there are more civil wars. It's actually a lot of it
for the last almost 60 years you have. Nine civil wars. It's a lot
it's a lot of turmoil, it's a lot of bloodletting, it's a lot of
internal conflict among the families themselves. Every single time
there's one of these civil wars, there are prescriptions where
members of the senatorial families are put on a list and either
executed or forced into exile every single time. So there is a lot of
chaos and a lot of really not very great feelings about the end of
the republic on anyone's part. So it's worth noting that when Lukan
is writing about this period, he's essentially saying that what
happened here, the rise of Caesar and ultimately the rise of
Augustus, the rise of an empire. This is not a good thing for various
reasons that we'll talk about. He he's not necessarily saying that
this is what he wants to go back to. Sinica, for example, his uncle
is writing about how there should be a republic. The empire should be
replaced with a republic. Remember that people went before Augustus
died, wanted him to in his will restore the republic. But it's not
this republic that they actually want back. No one wants this. No one
enjoyed living at this time. What they want is a return to something
more idealized, something where they actually have power, something
where the emperor is not the only one who's saying whatever the
emperor wants to say, they want the power back to themselves, these
important members of the senatorial family. Exactly what they wanted
that to look like is never really developed, the conspiracy is
discovered before. It actually has a chance to get going in its
assassination attempts. And all of the numbers are, like I said,
killed before. They really had a chance to articulate what it was
that they were going for. So just to take the civil war and question
this one here, I'm going to give you just the most bare bones version
of this. We have we have classes that cover this and a lot more
detail if you want more information. So in the year forty nine,
Julius Caesar crosses the Rubicon. Famously, this is cast as it
crosses the river into Rome, thereby starting a civil war that he
knows is coming. And his telling he literally wrote the book on his
own civil war. So we have to take what he says with a little bit of
salt here. But in his telling, he is doing this to defend himself.
This power-sharing agreement that he had with Pompeii broke down and
he was about to be implicated by the Senate on false charges, he
says. And so he is launching the civil war to defend himself from
these charges. Now, that's really the only first hand account that we
have, so we're not sure exactly realistically how this is all
developing, but the end result. Cesar marches on Rome with an army
that is a decent size, it's not enormous, but it's a decent sized
army. It is very experienced. It's been campaigning and go on Tour de
France, Belgium, parts of Germany, Spain campaigning in all for
years. It's a very experienced, very strong arming. The Senate in
Rome has nothing that can stand against it. So it frees the Senate,
most of it at least flea's. So you end up with two different rooms.
There's a room in the West, actually in Rome led by Caesar, and you
have Rome and the eastern Mediterranean in exile, led by the Senate,
which is actually led by Pompeii. And that's the setup for Lukins
description of the battle for Australia. So Pompeii and the Senate
flee east and then Pompey sends out a call for help. Now, Libya is
well known in Rome. The reason he is part of this first triumvirate,
the power sharing agreement to begin with is because Bobby Magnus
Pompey the Great went off over here to put down the pirates and ended
up conquering most of this for the Roman Republic, either conquered
it or he subjected the local kings to Roman rule as vassals. What
this meant is that within the span of a few years. The total income
of the Roman Republic tripled, which is a lot. Just think about it,
some senator or something here in this country managed to triple the
national income overnight. That would be a really, really big deal.
Right. So that's the power that we have. And in the way that Roman
politics work, when you do something like this, when you conquer a
kingdom or a territory and you install a new king that is friendly to
Rome, that king is not just friendly to Rome, that King obeys your
commands as well. So Pompey goes east. So where did all of this
support build up for his campaigns in the region? And he puts out a
call for allies. These are the allies that Lukan describes as coming
to Vasilis to fight for him. So what Pompey does is he gathers this
very large army made up of Romans and also non Roman troops from the
eastern Mediterranean. And all of them converge on Vasilis, as Caesar
does as well. Caesar sailed across the sea. There are some battles
that are fought. Some storms interfere with things, but ultimately
they they need for this climactic battle at Vasilis from the. All
right, so Poppy has an enormous army. By standards of the day, Cesar
is not a relatively small army, but it's a good army, sees his army,
his experience, his army is not made up of raw recruits who most of
them have never seen battle before. Caesar's army, although smaller,
all of them are experienced veterans. And so there's this this huge
dichotomy between them. And no one really knows how it's going to
play out. Poppy is not really very eager to fight, is not convinced
that he can win the historical accounts, tell us that he is not
actually convinced that he can win. And Lukan tells us that he's not
actually convinced that he can win, even though his army is larger,
it's weaker and he knows it. And the battle proves that out opening
moves of the battle, the cavalry is cavalry charges and they
outnumber seizures, they try to overwhelm his flank. Cesar knows this
is coming to an experience commander. He pulled back some of his
troops from each section of his army and forms this line of soldiers
that turns back the cavalry lobby's cavalry retreats. And then
sneezers own cavalry and that 4th line of infantry attack, Caesar's
main force holds down. All of these troops here runs in terms of its
length and threatens to surround. These troops are inexperienced.
They don't know how to how to redeploy in the middle of a battle.
That's something that more experienced troops like Caesar's are able
to do, not poppets. And so there's a general route Poppy's entire
force runs. They don't run back to his camp, which is fortified. It's
like they just run as fast as they can, as far away from the battle
as they possibly can. Like Caesar's own account, he loses a few
hundred troops, which ancient numbers are really complicated. We
don't know if that's true or not, but he only loses a few hundred as
compared to Pompey, who loses pretty much the entire army is either
killed on the field or surrenders in mass because these are troops.
The result is that the republic lobby really doesn't have an army
anymore. So the Senate and the senators who are following Pompey,
they scatter to different corners of the Roman. That's not really an
empire, but it's basically an empire they scatter to different
corners of the empire to try and raise up their own armies. Pompey
flees to Egypt, where he is executed, is captured by the Egyptian
king, Ptolemaic, who meets him at the docks. The story goes and kills
them immediately. Takes me completely by surprise because he and they
were friendly. And you thought the talented would give him help
against Caesar? And that's the battle. It's a catastrophic defeat for
Pompey, but because Pompey is leading this this group of senators and
Lukins telling it's not just a defeat for Poppy, it's a defeat for
the Republic of Rome. This is the last gasp of the Roman Republic as
tell. And so as he writes it, as he writes this history, climaxing
with the war, this is this is the narrative that it goes with. It's
not just a war between Pompey and Caesar. It's a war between the
Republic, the Free Republic of Free Romans and the what are you going
to say? The autocracy, the oppression that Caesar is about to usher
into the real world. So we open the books. We don't actually know all
of what Lincoln was intending to do with the book. The narrative
itself is pretty streamlined. He's not trying to have these larger
organizational units. There's no ring structure in here. There's no
grouping of books together. The way that we've seen with Virgil and
some of the other epics, it's pretty straight forward, like a history
would like. You guys read with Liddie starts in one place and just go
straight from there. So the storyline is a little bit more
streamlined because of that. We think that he's probably going for 12
books because that's kind of the standard by this point. That's what
Virgil used and it's what other epics tried to do with that. So I
give you the halves here. Assuming a book is the middle, it opens
with this encomium to narrow this glowing endorsement of Nero, and
it's his ability to be amazing. This is about the last time that
Lukken says anything nice about Nero in the epic right there at the
beginning. It's important, though, that it opens with an and coming
to Nero in the place where we would expect to have this invocation to
the gods. This is where he talks about Nero. And then from there he
goes on to say only negative things really about the royal family,
the imperial family. There's a reason I slipped and said, I'll come
back, all right, so the story goes that Caesar begins the Civil War
here, Lincoln against the wishes of Roma. That is the personification
of Rome herself as a city and of the Roman people as the goddess
Rama. And there are other evil moments. So Roma appears to Caesar and
brings other Romans with her to try and dissuade him from launching
this war. And Caesar ignores all of them because of his greed for
power until he launches the civil war of his own, not in defense in
the way that he tells it. Rome and other cities that are allied with
the Senate are cast into despair because of this this invasion that
they did not see coming. And Lukins telling and that they are
unprepared for. Some cities are laid siege to Caesar destroys others.
And the result is that Pompeii and everyone else who supports simply.
And then at the at one point here we have this this conversation
that's almost certainly made up by lookin for a point. We have a
figure named Kato, who's a historical figure living at this time, and
Kato is in the epic here arguing with Brutus. This is the Brutus who
would eventually be one of the assassins of Caesar, Caesar et tu
brute. That Caesar Caesar never said that to protect other ones from
Teckman spoke Greek word. So Kato is arguing with Brutus, trying to
convince Brutus to join the war effort against Caesar. And what he's
arguing for is this idea of a just war against an evil oppressor. And
I put just one in quotes here because there's not a concept of a just
war prior to this. It's not that looting is developing this concept,
but this idea of a war that is itself just and fulfills will sense
order to the world. This doesn't really exist prior to this point in
the Roman Empire. It's an idea that's being developed at this time.
And so it's it's completely anachronistic for Kato to argue about a
just war in favor of this idea. But it suits Lukins narrative. And
with this idea of justice against an evil oppressor, it manages to
convince Brutus to join the war eventually. Yeah, that also criticism
against task force. In other words, the Romans engaged in, because it
sort of implies that we're not just in some ways. Yeah. Like all of
these. Yeah. Yeah. All of this is because of the greed that these men
had for single power, not the interests of the people, like all of
them playing solo and various. And Caesar and all of them wanted to
fight. They claim to defend the will of the people. But as look at
say, that's not actually what's happening. So, please, they raise
their armies and they rally around Poppy. Meanwhile, Caesar is
victorious in the West. Obbie rallies everyone in the east and they
all prepare for war. And then we have these two conflicting oracles
that are going to give conflicting prophecies. The Oracle of Delphi,
that is the old oracle of the old style Oracle in Greece produces a
prophecy that is confusing. And there are different ways to interpret
it, and no one is really sure what they're supposed to do. The not so
veiled reference to the idea of casting off these old traditions in
favor of something new, which is presented by a powerful which in
itself gives a better prophecy that is more immediately apparent. She
raises up a dead soldier killed in one of these skirmishes before the
Battle of Vasilis. And through this necromancy, the soldier who has
been down into the underworld much in the same way that innocence
went down into the underworld to learn about the future, the soldier
brings knowledge of the future back from the underworld, and he tells
what's about to happen. He tells about this great battle that's about
to be fought, about how Pompey will be defeated and ultimately
killed. But Caesar is also going to be killed. So this sets up the
idea that everything else that follows this, if this is the first
half here, it sets up the idea that the second half of the episode is
going to be a tragedy and it's an epic tragedy in that old style.
This is why we think it's the end of that first half. And then book
seven men under that construction, what you guys read would be the
beginning of the second. Any questions of our. All right, so where do
we start? Look, seven, let's think about the narrative here. So this
season really came out the other one, but yeah, yeah, Pompey's dream
is dreaming about his glory days, dreaming about this time when he
was that Spain put down a rebellion in Spain and dreaming about this.
It's not like his most crowning achievement, but it is something from
his past that he's proud of. This is a time when he knew what he was
supposed to do. He was convinced that what he was doing was actually
right. There was no ambiguity in his mind that what he needed to do
needed to be done. So he's dreaming about that. And then he's woken
up and cast into this this harsh reality that he finds himself in at
Vasilis. He's woken up, brought back into this world. And we hear
about a council. We've seen countless times before this is not really
that surprising, but here it's a little bit different. What is the
council saying here or rather what does she think needs to happen at
this council? Out of curiosity, how many people have the text in
front of them? OK, let's bring in Texas. Sorry, is this the part
where you have to convince somebody to actually press the attack on
these things? Yeah, yeah. Pompey is reluctant because in Lukins,
telling is a good person who doesn't actually want to fight this
battle. He's not fighting against against rebels or barbarians. He's
fighting against the Romans in a civil war. And he knows that
whatever happens, Romans are going to die and that blood will be on
his hands. He's not actually going to establish peace through this
battle will just lead to more conflict. He knows that. So what he
wants to do is win without fighting. And he thinks he can do that.
But then we have this this figure from the Cicero Cicero, again, is a
historical figure, not actually at the ballot. Cicero appears here,
and again, everyone in the audience would have recognized. Now wait a
minute, Cicero wasn't at the battle. What is he doing here? Cicero is
a voice in this case as a symbol for the values of the Old Republic,
the values that made Popi fight. There's this moral imperative that
Cicero argues that he has to fight the good battle, fight the good
fight, even if it is destructive, even if he doesn't think he can
win. He still has to do what's right. We hear about these old heroes
from the Old Republic, figures like Camila's, who is the second
founder of Rome. Romulus founded The City. And then centuries later,
it gets attacked by a. Band of Goles Tribe, name of which I don't
remember. The city gets sacked and burned to the ground and Camila's
is the one who refound it. That's the name that Cicero uses to try
and inspire Pompey to fight as if he can be another founder of Rome.
He can stave off this existential threat that Rome now faces and do
something great as his name Magnus demands he does. This is the old
value. The moral imperative that Cicero is a symbol of the old
republic is trying to convince them to follow. And it doesn't work,
it's destructive, Poppy knows it's going to be destructive. But he
does it anyway because of this moral imperative. Following this, we
have Mars appearing and creating panic and confusion, which army,
though, does Mars create panic and confusion in? Did you guys catch
this? It's actually both there's this idea that Mars, as the
embodiment of war, is himself unpredictable, the very first temple of
Mars in Rome. It's not actually allowed to be built inside the city
limits. It has to be built outside the city limits because Mars, as
an unpredictable deity, cannot be allowed to be inside the city of
Rome once Mars is unleashed. He is destructive of everything.
Unpredictably, he can kill friend and foe alike. And so Mars here is
coming down into the battle and spreading panic and confusion among
both armies. Because of that unpredictability, loaded symbolism in
there that will come back to Caesar's army as an army of veterans is
better able to deal with that panic that poppies. And so Lukin can
can lay some blame here. And then we get these these battlefield
speeches, Poppy Witkacy, that Caesar gives a speech Poppy does. So
also we've seen this kind of speeches on the battlefield except in
older traditions, we would expect these speeches to be given to the
opposing side or at least two heroes from the opposing side in the
Iliad. Caesar and Poppy would ride out in front of their armies and
talk to each other. That's not what happens here. Here they're
talking to their men, talking to the common men, which is kind of
interesting. But also what they're saying is very symbolic of the
values that each side embodies. Caesar whips his soldiers into a
bloodthirsty frenzy. He's saying that they can be canings if they win
this battle. Now, we've seen kings before. So I'm teaching different
classes that we're all reading versions of the same things I'm trying
to remember. Yes, we've seen kids. What are the Romans think of
Kingson? That unmitigated disaster is king, right, if you want to
insult someone in the late republic, you call them a king. People
called Caesar a king and it wasn't because he was trying to be one,
it was because they wanted to insult him. So Caesar saying this to
his soldiers, saying this to average people, average citizens of
Rome. It's not this is not what you're supposed to do. And you're not
supposed to whip your soldiers into a bloodthirsty, friendly frenzy.
You're supposed to inspire them with acts of terror, with
descriptions of acts of heroism. That's what we would expect. This is
very cinematic moment. You can see this this being in a movie or
something, except this is what Caesar does. This is what Caesar does
with his moment. And that contrasts very, very sharply with comedy,
reminding them of their duty. Actually, I got that confused. This is
where Camila's comes in, not with Cicero. Sorry about that. But the
point is they're Cicero's convincing Pompey to follow these examples.
This is where Camelot's Pompey reminds his soldiers of their duty by
appealing to these old values, these almost all values and the heroes
in the Old Republic, the heroes like the ones that Virgil cites. When
NASA goes down into the underworld and sees all the heroes of Rome,
those same figures are the ones that he reminds his soldiers of that
as if by being those soldiers and embodying their virtues, they can
win the battle. And so we set up this very, very sharp contrast
between the two armies and between their leaders. And we have a
battle, which is. Pretty straightforward the told you how the battle
goes and history Lukins account of it is pretty much the same. And
then we have Pompey withdrawing. That's a little bit different.
Instead of the troops routing and running away in fear here, Pompey
chooses once he realizes the battle is lost, he chooses to have the
Army retreat and withdraw because he doesn't want them to waste their
lives. He wants to protect his men, as many of them as he can, and he
orders them to withdraw orderly if possible, which is not how the
battle actually played out. This is Luke and trying to put a spin on
poppets defeat also to contrast with Caesar. So Pompey wants to
protect as many of his troops as he can and orders them to withdraw
because of that. That is immediately contrasted with Caesar, who
after the battle in Caesar Caesar to counter this, strolls the
battlefield, sees all of these dead, recognize his friends and family
members on the battlefield for both sides, and weeps openly at what
has happened here. Caesar sheds no tears. He has a table and a stool
brought out and he literally feasts among the dead while dogs and
carrion birds tear the corpses to pieces around him. That's how this
yet that's not that itself is actually a reference to the beginning
of the Eliot. Sing Goddess of the Wrath of Achilles Pelleas, the
wrath that sent many countless sorrow translated, that sent countless
heroes down to the house of Haiti's as food for dogs and carrion
birds, thus fulfilling the will of zoos. That's the opening of the
Iliad. It's elaborated and made real and at least pseudo historical
here by at. And that scene is the end of the battle. This is the
death of the republic, according to Luke. And it goes on from there,
although these books is where it starts to get a little fragmentary
and spotty. This is somewhere around and here is where Lukan was
discovered and died. So Poppy then flees to Egypt. In reality and
history, he and Tony had been on good terms that he thought Pompey
Pompey thought that he and Ptolemy were friends, and so he's going to
Egypt to try and get more troops to get support to continue the war
against Caesar. And he was taken by surprise when Ptolemy ambushes
them on the beach and kills them. Here he is made into a more noble
figure. He knows that his death is coming and he goes willingly to
face it. Anyway, it's almost a messianic figure in this respect,
going to sacrifice his own life so that the republic can continue. He
hopes so that under new leadership, maybe the army of the Senate can
have a different result. This is Lukins spin on this. As we can
infer, at least it doesn't quite work out that way. That's Pompey's
hope until he goes to his death as Tony the king of the them. And
then Caesar comes on, follows them close behind he arrives on the
scene, is greeted by Ptolemy. And in both accounts, Ptolemy presents
Caesar with with Pompey's head as a gift and Caesar's account. He
sees the head and and turns away. Covering his face was cloak to hide
his tears because he is ashamed that this is what happens to a man as
great as Poppy. For better or worse, the two men had a history that
went back decades with one another. They have been family at one
point. So this is not the end that even Caesar, as he says, wanted to
see Pompeii come true. He's also enraged that the king here, the
Egyptian king, would have the. I guess to to kill a Roman of the
stature that Caesar is telling here in Lukins, telling Caesar turns
away and covers his face because he wants to hide the fact that he is
overjoyed that Pompeya has come to such a gruesome end again, playing
up the barbarity of Caesar. And then the very end, somewhere around
in here is where it breaks off so that that Kaito from the beginning
of the book that argues in favor of a just war, this Kaito becomes
the commander of the Senate's army while Caesar waste time in Egypt.
And then right at the very end, before it cuts off, we have a couple
of assassination attempts against Caesar and Caesar's in the middle
of fighting, the second of these assassination attempts off when it
just stops abruptly. Presumably, that's when Lincoln was arrested.
And that's said the narrative is fairly straightforward. There's a
lot of spin, right? We have two accounts there, Caesar's own account.
And there's Lincoln's account and the two contrasts in most respects.
And it's that contrast that everyone in Rome would have recognized.
So let's think about that. We're going to talk with the society that
I want you to think about the gods, what are the gods doing here in
this epic? Mars is no Mars is being disrupted for the sake of being
destructive, because that's kind of what Mars does. And you can
certainly I mean, enrollment to you don't invoke Mars unless you
really, really have to. There are lots of other words that you appeal
to if you want a successful outcome. Mars is not one that you go to
first, say Mars is hanging out here on the battlefield being Mars.
What else? Because even though he is able to overcome that and the
warning about thing able to disregard that. That's interesting that
the guards just kind of warn him they don't take any action to really
stop him. Their guards, presumably they could do that, but they
don't. And this gets to what we can assign throughout the whole thing
obviously gets to what it gets to something that Lukan believes about
the guards philosophically throughout the epic, the guards are either
absent completely, they're just not there or they're completely
ineffective or at various times looking actively questions whether or
not they even exist. So we have outright hostility and denial toward
the beginning of Book seven here, where Lukan questions their
existence and even since they don't exist. The exit of the gods, so
that doesn't come in. I mean, yes, chronologically, but Christianity
hasn't spread that far yet. At this point. Most Romans are still
worshipping the old gods. And in the next epic, they're still
worshipping the next category. Next week, they're still worshipping
the old gods. At the end of next week is when we're going to see that
transition. And actually even in that transition, they don't
immediately reject all of the mythology of tradition. It's kind of
interesting. But he is rejecting the existence of the gods for a
reason. At other times, he's questioning their power, their power or
their usefulness very directly in their. He's the story goes that he
is one of them. There are several who are are rather famous for that.
Well. The story goes on 60 or I think you're sixty four, there's a
big fire in Rome burns enormous part of the city, and the Nero blames
the fire on Christians and then proceeds to buy up most of the land
that had burned to build himself a fancy palace. But it's actually
not clear from the historical record if he actually thought that the
Christians that the fire or if he's using that as a convenient excuse
to buy up all this land to renovate Rome. But that is somewhere in
this period is when we do begin to see Christians being. Put into
various spectacles and games, then executions, so this is happening
at this time, but I don't think that's why Lucas is saying this, if
that's where does that answer your question? So will you be doing
this partially because I know that Cicero is very famous and infamous
for sort of being like the modern day atheist in support of one of
his writings, do describe some skepticism towards the gods. So would
that be part of it? And it also be because in a way, this thing that
we can see is this great thing, the public, with the fact that it
failed. And the fact that an entire point of the republic was that it
was divinely ordained by the gods, made by contract with Jupiter and
Nesto and their own gods. So the fact that it falls and fallen, that
also be a catalyst for this belief. Yeah, yeah, exactly. He's drawing
on this idea, like you said, that all of this had been the divinely
protected Roman state. And if the gods are doing all of this well,
maybe the gods themselves aren't actually worthwhile. That's his
idea. And he's drawing it's not just looking at this. It's a major
trend in Roman philosophy. At times. There's this mix of special
blend of Roman stoicism and epicurean ism. It's very common in the
Roman upper class at the time that rejects the utility of the gods
doesn't always go so far as to say the gods don't exist. More of the
gods are over there and they don't really care what we're doing. So
we should care what they're doing. The gods exist, but they have no
interaction with people. So humans need to do the things that humans
need to do. That's that's sort of the philosophy here. And
ultimately, the agency of everything that happens is placed on
humans. So the agency of everything negative, it allows Luke into
place that Caesar and the agency have everything positive can be
placed with Pompey. Very few times when we do see the gods acting or
being appealed to, it's usually not with pomp, it's actually with
Caesar. So Caesar appeals to them directly in line to ninety seven.
And then at one point just before this, the narrator that is looking
is asking Caesar what what unusual gods that is the gods who are not
the normal protectors of the Roman state. Which gods are those that
Caesar appealed to in order to subvert the natural order. Which gods
did Caesar appeal to that allowed him to pull off this victory?
Because the victory cannot possibly have been ordained by any normal
God? That's that's the thinking Bell's. So the gods only help Caesar
and only then their unusual gods, you don't normally appeal to gods
of magic and witchcraft in the underworld and everything else in
every other situation. According to Lukan, gods simply don't exist
unless it's war itself, the personification of war, blind and
unpredictable, once unleashed. And so what we have to have is Lukins
voice being very presence throughout, and he's injecting his own
philosophy. He's injecting his own personal history through his own
voice. And this is why Dr. Joe. Jane Joyce. So actually, one of my
professors, Dr. Slip, said that's why she pulled out the voice of the
narrator in italics, because this is actually really important. This
is the time when we begin to see a shift from the narrator being an
objective observer, the one who speaks with the voice of the gods.
This is when we stop seeing that and we start to see the narrator
being kind of partisan in the story that they're telling. They are
very directly crafting the story, not with the voice of the gods, but
with their own their own mindset and their own opinions. And so this
is a pretty big break. This period right in here is when we begin to
see an ability to equate the narrator's voice very directly with what
the author thinks about the world. We can't always do that as we go
back in time, but we can do that from here on forward. And to
underscore this point that it is his story that he's telling, even
though at this point he says he can barely continue overcome by
grief, to underscore that it is his point of view that telling. He
has these rhetorical devices. This is why he inserts these
anachronisms in here, these things that are out of place against
Cicero never being at the battle. But Cicero is there to be the
symbol of these old moral values of the old republic. And Cicero is
there and other figures are there to downplay the victor. If you are
rooting for the guy that everyone in your audience knows loses, you
have to figure out a way to undercut Caesar at every possible moment.
You have to undercut that victory. And so that's why he plays up
Caesar's barbarity, his bloodthirstiness, and not just Caesar's, but
his soldiers as well in order to play of the defeated virtues, Pompey
and his soldiers. And so what if he does this with those
anachronisms, but he also has this very long view of time that sort
of collapses time as well. So toward the end of this book, we get
this conflation of the battle of Vasilis, which is what just happened
with another battle called Phillipi, which is actually in a different
civil war nearby. But this is the battle where Mark Antony and
Octavius finally cornered some of the some of Caesar's assassins and
defeated them. Completely different battle of a completely different
war, but is collapsing them together to blend all of the crimes of
all of the Giulio clients, Caesar and Augustus Octavia together to
emphasize that there is this line of continuity through all of the
Juliar clients to be driven by power and the thirst for blood. With.
But I had rearranged this to go into the language that will give you
the literature, I guess with the literary background here, we see
some things that we've come to come to find familiar. The epic
similes are still used, but in a much older style way, not the
Hellenistic way, but going back to the old way where they're just
used for flavor. Lukan is not trying to show off any special
knowledge, is downplaying all of that tradition in order to play up
the personalities of the characters that he's using. We do see some
use of myth and drama, but if we're going to reject the gods and
their existence, or at least they're their usefulness, we also kind
of have to reject all of the mythology that's built up around the
gods. So the myth is downplayed and all of that plays up the human
agency behind all of these actions. We get type scenes, but
similarly, they're a little bit different. They are geared toward
playing up against the personalities and the motivations. The type
scenes don't at this point have a whole lot to do with what we have
seen in previous epics. You look at the language, the formulas are
completely gone at this point. They are not formulaic. They're barely
even formulaic in their description, let alone having formulas in
them. It's almost as if they are there because this is a convention
of epic. This is what needs to be in there, Lincoln would think so.
It feels compelled to include these things. So the description of
battle is kind of formulaic in the way that it happens. It's
recognizable if we have read The Iliad, but it doesn't actually copy
any of the scenes or descriptions. We have an army scene, but it's
it's barely the same. It's where the soldiers are picking out their
weapons. They're not picking out specific items of weaponry or armor
and putting them on in any particular manner. It's just a description
of soldiers arming themselves because that's what happens before a
battle. That's what you need to say. We have a catalogue of allies,
but it's only of one side and it's only a Pompey's side to document
that the entirety of the world is coming to fight Caesar. And it's
not just the death of Pompeii. It's not just the defeat of the
republic. It's the death of hope for the world. And he's underscoring
this with this catalogue of allies. We have the battle speeches,
which I've already talked about. Caesar and Pompey both give one, but
not to each other, to the to the average common soldier elevates the
role of human agency here again. And then we have a perversion or
distortion of these battlefield speeches where Caesar openly mocks a
defeated and mortally wounded general of Pompey's, not talking to
them about great deeds. He's not exchanging family histories. They
don't exchange an article of armor or weaponry that we would see in
the Iliad. Caesar is just mocking him cruelly so that his last
moments will be as miserable as possible to all of these things are
changing slowly to emphasize Caesar's barbarity. And the language
itself emphasizes this, all of the language places the blame for
everything that happens solely on Caesar. It's very propagandistic.
So we hear about scissored, greedy longing for kingship, we hear
about him whipping his troops up, mocking defeated enemies, and then
again dining at the end with dogs and carrion birds among the dead.
All of this language, again, of kingship, kingship, being a king,
acting kingly, any word that roughly translates to something having
king in it, Lukan uses because it draws that line not just from
Caesar to Augustus, but also to Nero. The tyrant, the autocrat of
Lukins own de. This, incidentally, is why Lukken was arrested and
charged with treason. He's not just going after these these
particular historical figures, he's going after the founders of
Nero's ruling dynasty. And so this is this is the undercurrent that
runs through all of this. It's not just the tale of history. It's not
just playing out these two people. It's the philosophies that they
that they embody. We just ask you. So what does Pobby embody as a
hero? What virtues does Pompeian. He wants peace. He's only fighting,
as I was told to do, is only fighting a defense, right? What else
there? No one would say that. Acts like he's carried along by faith
and duty in the way that we see in the Aeneid or the way that Libby
described some of the soldiers or some of his heroes, doesn't really
want to do it, but he knows he has to and he can't escape that fate.
He wants the best for the state. He actively tries to protect his
soldiers in the battlefield. That's why he orders the retreat and
look instead. It's not because the battle's lost and there's no hope
and the soldiers just turn around and run. That would be a lack of
virtue here. Obvious trying to protect them. It's the highlights he
wants to avoid war modelled on the old heroes of the early republic,
cares about his men, also leads an army made up entirely of
patrician's, that is, people who are virtuous in the Roman
constructivists, which is strange because at the same time, he talks
about families being split by the war. So one brother fighting in
Pompey's army and another brother fighting in Caesar's army and the
brothers actually fight each other on the field of battle. Except one
of them is a patrician, apparently, and a member of the upper class
and the senatorial family. And the other one is a member of the
lowest classes you can actually do and Roman society. But anyway,
this is the idea, the idea being that his army is made up entirely of
people who have a noble character who have this nobility to them. All
right, so this is Poppy. What decision it might be a stretch to call
Seether a hero in this epic brutality? Yeah, what else? He does kind
of have a hadn't thought of that. He does kind of have a moment of
Oresteia sort of vicariously. Yeah, yeah. That has his his thirst for
blood is entirely geared toward personal gain. Poppy wants to serve
his people, protect them. Caesar wants the exact opposite of
ambition. He wants power more than anything else, wants to be a king
specifically. Again, that word the Romans hate this word, like
literally hate it. And so the number of times that that Lukan calls
him a king is important. It's intentional. He relishes in bloodshed,
death and leads an army made up of plebeians, not the patrician, not
the noble classes, not these people who are innately imbued with a
noble quality, but rather basically psychopathic mercenaries. And
this is the army that Caesar brings to destroy the republic. The
distend here is pretty obvious, right? We have one side embodying the
most meirong, embodying its principles, the early republic, embodying
these principles that Virgile extolled as well on the other side
embodies literally everything else. There's not a word for it in
Latin. It's just the opposite, the polar opposite of the most
violent. So this wasn't very popular. It actually was wildly popular.
Yeah, I feel like it's all there. This is like the most personal one.
This is actually one people death. So, I mean, yeah, I think that's
the key there. It's that it's that gap of time where you can remember
Caesar. But also there's enough gap where you can remember that
Caesar is actually standing for Nero and all of the excesses that
Nero had display. Remember, he started out with this really great
hope that he would be a philosopher king, like a platonic model, and
then that died very quickly. And so that idea, the excesses of Nero,
that's what people are understanding Caesar to be. And so it makes
this whole thing a subversive epic we haven't really seen before.
We're used to modern literature being subversive by modern
literature. One of the things that makes modern literature great. And
if you look at a list of great books or something like that, you see
things that are social commentary. You see things that are subversive
to whatever society they're written. And we have not seen that yet.
We see it for the first time here. And it's really underscored by
this question that is openly asked on line one thirty three, what
will Rome be? And then what will Rome be if Caesar wins, what will be
as popular as it would have been if Caesar had lost? And this
question can only be asked in a subversive epic written under an
emperor like Nero, who didn't care to shape his own propaganda,
farmed that out to other people, which is why Lukken was able to
write it for as long as it could by a man like Lukan who was executed
for sedition. This is a big step. It's a big difference from what
we've read before. What he is saying, essentially, is that the shame
here, the personal shame that has come over the Roman people of
Lukins on say it's not to have a king like Nero emperors, kings in
all but name as Lukan saying the shame isn't to have a king, but to
willingly submit to one, as he says, openly line for sex and
willingly to choose the slavery of the kingship over the freedom of
the republic. This is the Latin language. This is these are the words
that he's using to describe servitude and the freedom of a republic.
It's easy to see why he and Nero didn't get along so well. The end
the gods themselves cannot be used with this construct, with this
idea of what will be the gods can't be used because gods tend to
validate the victor. Caesar literally wrote the book on his civil war
because he was the victor and the gods favored him in his own
telling. So we can't have the gods take an active role here because
the gods favored Caesar. We have to downplay the gods in favor of
other things. If we wanted to revive the defeated army of Pompeii in
the morals that they stood for, he had to downplay everything else in
order to do that. So the morality at the heart of all of this comes
out repeatedly in every single book. I just give you a couple of
examples here from Book one, which we didn't read The Victorious
Cause Pleased the gods that the conquered comments, please. This is
the Cato argued for a just war, even if it was futile, even if it was
destructive, it was the right thing to do and needed to be done. And
throughout the world and for all time we as in as in the republic, as
in all good people and Lukins understand our ruined because of this
this catastrophic defeat of the republic. And this sets up this
conflict between the idea of Caesarism as it was, I guess you could
translate it what was being discussed at the time versus
Republicanism, that is a system of government run by as a republic.
And there's the conflict. Is that Caesarism, that is a single
autocrat coming to power to bring stability? There's there's a
logical fallacy here. The state with the capitalist benefits most
from the stability that is offered by a single autocratic ruler like
Caesar Augustus or Nero. But the individual people, the average
person on the street does not the average person on the street
suffers from that kind of autocracy. They benefit most from the
freedom of self-government, as in a republic which is wildly unstable
as the Roman construct of its own republic. And so there's this
conflict, and no one really had a good answer to how to resolve this.
But everyone at the time acknowledged that there were these two poles
combating each other. And so Lukan is criticizing not just the idea
of an autocratic ruler, not just the idea of Caesar, but criticizing
the very basis for that government. And in so doing, he's being
subversive there. And we've seen this before. I didn't really talk
about it. I remember Dito and Turness, remember how their sympathetic
characters. Didn't really talk about why they're sympathetic
characters, but one of the reasons why they're so sympathetic is
because Virgil himself, in writing the the glowing endorsement of
Augustus, he might not actually have been all that comfortable with
the idea of a single person ruling the Roman Empire, Roman St.. You
might have been uncomfortable with the idea of Augustus as an
autocrat, even if he recognized the benefits of the peace that
Augustus was bringing. And so you might have worked some of this in
there, not as a way of criticizing Augustus, but as a way of
expressing the potential danger there of having an autocratic ruler.
Again, no one at the time knew that this was going to become an
empire. Lots of people were hoping that Augustus would just take
power and then give it back when he was done with it. But by Lukins
time, that had not been the case. So it's worth asking what exactly
we wanted. No one wanted to go back to this. Lukken is advocating for
a republic. It's not really clear what kind of republic he wanted,
but essentially what he's saying. Is that the case, the sense of
peace and calm and order that ended all of the chaos of these nine
civil wars and other conflicts came at the cost of really brutally
eliminating everything else that stood against it. Caesar and
Augustus and Nero and everyone else in that family brought peace only
by extreme brutality and a lot of bloodletting. Right. When they came
to power, they had already exiled and executed a large number of
people. Augustus Caesar both pardoned a lot of people to. But the
people that they had pardoned had also fought against them, where
most of those ringleaders had already been killed or taken their own
lives after losing the battles so they can afford to be generous,
they can afford to pardon some of these people because the worst of
their opponents were already dead. So there's a lot of brutality that
marks this period. And by not recognizing the possibility that other
voices that has other ideas of governing government could exist and
slaughtering all of those voices without mercy or hesitation looking
is drawing, drawing attention to the idea that this is not actually a
good thing. This system of government that we have, we in his own day
have it's not working. It's not working at all. We might have
relative peace. We might have the ability to not live through civil
wars. But what's the cost of that peace? He never articulates what
the alternative is, is seduced by the ideal of having this other
option, but he never really gets around to articulating what that is.
No one in that conspiracy really articulated what it was that they
wanted. So I don't really have an answer for that, but that's where
we leave it there. And let me have the answer, the cell phone that he
put it into his epic. So this is the. That look back at that golden
age of Augustus that we don't always get right. Not everyone
considered that a golden age. And so with the turmoil and strife is
eventually assassinated. There's another civil war in the year. Sixty
nine. There are four different emperors that come to power. And at
the end of that, we have a different dynasty entirely. And it's in
that dynasty that the next author is writing to right off the bat.
And so it's not really looking any better from his point of view. And
so from that point of view, that point of view of everything is still
garbage. That's where is writing the bad. So keep that in mind as you
read for Tuesday.</p>

<h3 class="western"><a name="_xta1gc4bagi9"></a>Alexander Romance 3</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> OK, so they. At the last we look at
this, it's not technically an epic, but we're going to talk about the
last of these traditions, tradition behind the traditions of. Unless
you read The Romance Romance by Alexander, you guys look at this.
Very straightforward and easy to understand. Yeah, it's not the
whoever the author is, it's not trying to make any deep philosophical
points. They're just presenting what they think of the life of
Alexander as pretty straightforward. Do we think that this is what
actually happened to Alexander? You find everything believable and
what you were reading. Some of it is going from India to Ethiopia in
one day. I like that one. Yeah, it's. Just really bad. There is a
labor tradition where Alexandra rides a flying horse and it is
actually possible that's where this comes from or where that comes
from. Yeah, it's, um, this is the transition from Alexander as a
historical figure to Alexander as a Simmi mythic folk hero. And it's
an interesting transition because in the Hellenistic period, in the
very beginning of the Romans, you have this historical Alexander in
the world conqueror. And then really quickly he becomes this
philosopher king with almost no relation whatsoever to the historical
figure. And that philosopher king is the one that's known throughout
most of the rest of history. It's only really since the 19th century
that people have focused on Alexander the Conqueror again for most of
the rest of that time. It's this version of Alexander that had more
social currency and notoriety before we start there. I want to start
in a few other places. Anyone ever seen the man who shot Liberty
Valance, watch. Right, so it's it's a good movie. It's a product of
its time. So it's not without controversy, but there's this line at
the end of the movie when the legend becomes fact. Print the legend
Jimmy Stewart is this aging politician is telling the story of how he
entered politics. And the story that he tells from his own experience
has nothing to do with what everyone else who has been voting for him
all these years. Things happen. And he's telling this to a roomful of
reporters who at the end of this stand up, tear off their notepads
and throw their notes in fire and say that, like, when the legend
becomes fact, print the legend. So what's interesting is we see
references or quotes that say something really similar in the. So
strange talking about the life of Alexander the rather the afterlife
of Alexander is talking about one of Alexander's biographers on a
secretase who was an admirable, admirable admiral in Alexander's navy
that accompanied Alexander E, and he says that onas separatists
better become the captain of unbelievable things, literally the
things that cannot be believed rather than an author of Alexander's
biography. For all those who accompanied Alexander preferred the
marvelous things, the marvelous stories to anything that was true.
But the sickness seems to have surpassed all others and is telling of
marvelous stories. Is the captain of lives, not of anything else.
Because very quickly after Alexander's death, the historical figure
was surpassed by all of these other things. The facts cease to be
printed in favor of the legend. And so when we look at the afterlife
of Alexander, that's kind of what we see. We see this this legend
extending really far geographically into areas that Alexander himself
never went. So in the in the 14th through 16th centuries, there we
have the Bingol sultanate over here in Bangladesh and India down the
coast of Myanmar. And it's founded by a guy named Shamsuddin, who,
among other titles, took the title, the second Alexander, and he had
a son named Sikander. Second being the Bengali. Bengali version of a
Persian version of the name Alexander is naming his son after
Alexander Royals' don't name their son randomly, they choose this
name very careful. And so what we see is that they are these two men
in particular and the rest of the Bengali sultanate dynasty. They are
choosing aspects of Alexander Thrane to take on and emulate. And
they're not trying to be. That's not why they're doing this at all.
What they're doing, what they're the qualities that they are trying
to apply here have to do with the mythical Alexander the Alexander,
the Sage King, whose pursuit of knowledge and wisdom defined his
reign, not the world conquer. That's the model. That's the memory
that had currency in the society. And in doing so, he was tying
himself in and his son into these traditions that stretched all the
way from South Asia through Central Asia and to to West Asia into
North Africa and Europe. It's very long spread of tradition. So to
understand this and why he's doing this, we have to go back and
understand how that transition happened from a historical figure,
world banker to the philosopher sage. Let's start with historical
Alexander, the son of the king of Macedonia, with a relatively small
area. His father expanded into central Greece and the price Alexander
conquered the entire rest of this. He conquered the territory, as you
can see here. But very, very little of this is actually in the
romance. Very little of this is in that later tradition that you guys
read. Instead, we have a very different picture of Alexander. Now,
we'll come back to that a second, but we have to understand what we
mean by some of our terms here, a romance is a refrain that or using
that term in a pretty modern definition here, a romance in the sense
that it is not a tragedy, as in the characters don't all die at the
end and have horrible things happen to them. But for moral,
philosophical reasons, it's not a comedy either. The characters don't
end happily into the tale happily, and it's also just not funny. It's
also not an epic as in it's not a poem and it's not trying to
preserve any sort of cultural knowledge or romance in the ancient and
evil tradition. It's a sort of a catchall category for anything that
doesn't fit easily into any of the other literary categories. In
general, it's a rousing story, it's supposed to be entertaining. It
focuses on human emotions and the human story in a relatively simple,
straightforward narrative. It might have a moral lesson here and
there, but it doesn't really have to. And so we can see that in the
romance there are moral lessons, but not very many of them, because
that's not really what it's going for. It's intended to be
entertaining more than anything else. What this romance is coming out
of our stories of Alexander's life that began circulating during the
Hellenistic period right after he died, there was this huge appetite
for stories about his life, not just his life, but also the life of
anyone who went with him. Stories about the lands that he traveled
through, the people that he conquered, the people that he didn't
conquer but still encountered. There's this huge appetite for
literature in that vein and on those topics. And it coincides with
the rise of something to talk about this idea of folklore and
Hellenistic literature, to remember you remember the with the
adaptation of wisdom literature into other areas like the catalog of
fish sort of things. So all of this appetite for knowledge of other
places and other cultures, other people, other things in nature and
the natural world, all of this is coinciding together. And so the
appetite for stories of Alexander's life ties into all of that. Most
of these stories are probably oral tradition until about the third
century or so, for about five hundred years. It's just oral tradition
about Alexander's life. You have a couple of histories, one or two
biographies, and then that's it. Everything else is oral stories
entering into this sort of background of folklore that in the third
century begins to be written down into the romance. And it's at this
point that we begin to have these fantastic details, these things
that are literally unbelievable, entering into the historical
narrative. The form that you guys read probably does not actually
develop until about the 10th century. That's very, very much later
than we've been talking about. It's about the same time as what you
guys are going to actually it's a little bit earlier than what you
guys are going to read next in the last epic in class. So we have to
keep in mind the span of time here. This is very, very late. By the
time this is written down, Alexander has been dead for more than a
thousand years. All right, so when you look at the storyline, it is a
pretty straightforward narrative as it is, and it's told in a very
straightforward manner, but that doesn't mean the narrative itself is
always easy to follow. We'll come back to life. So in the first book,
we hear about Alexander, his illegitimate parentage. Now the
historical Alexander was not illegitimately born son of a king with a
very well defined parentage as the king would have to have in the
story, though, he's actually born from the military of his mother
with an agent, a wandering Egyptian king named Honeyball, who was
actually modeled on an Egyptian king who had been dead for several
hundred years before Alexander was born. But in this tradition, NAWBO
was kicked out of his kingdom by the Persians, goes to Macedonia,
ends up sleeping with Alexander's mother. Philip finds out about
this. Somehow I don't remember the exact story there, eventually
Alexander grows up, learns about all of this, learns about how awful
his real father is and about his illegitimate father, ends up killing
them both and then sets out to conquer Virgil. It's convoluted story
beginning there, but he eventually sets out controversial, the only
reason that any of this is in there is to explain why Alexander goes
to Egypt first, why he doesn't just march to Persia and then keep
going. Historically, he went to Egypt first. This sets out an
Egyptian parentage for Alexander. It explains why he didn't just go
to Egypt as a conqueror. He went to Egypt to reclaim his birthright,
that sense of that. So that's why he goes to conquer Persia via Egypt
and then he takes a detour somehow. Going to Persia takes a detour
for Greece and then Italy and then somehow ends up in Persia somehow.
Throughout all of this, he's writing letters to the Persian king,
Darius, who is a real figure historically, this is who Alexander
campaigned against, fought against. But here they are writing letters
to each other and discussing deep philosophical thoughts about the
nature of kingship, the nature of divinity and rightful rule and
things like this. None of that happened. But this is developing
Alexander's interest in knowledge and philosophy in the context of
the romance. And then at the very end of the book one here we have
some details about his military campaigns against the Persians. That
part is reasonable, historical. Now, I forgot to mention when he
kills some of this is tying into other traditions, too. It's tying
into expectations that the audience would have of what a hero is. So
we've heard several heroes who either kill their fathers or
indirectly caused the death of their fathers. So Oedipus did this.
Theseus did this with Discuses Wassailing back. He forgot to raise
the proper colored sale if his father killed himself as a result.
Read that part in and Catullus. So this is tying into audience
expectations of what a hero means based on an earlier tradition. At
second, but continues with the riots now losing the war, the allies
himself with Paris, who is in this tradition, the king of India.
There was no king of India historically, Horus was the king of.
Taxila, which is a small kingdom in the Indus Valley, modern day
Pakistan, but here, Derice, alliance with porous. And that alliance
is used to explain why Alexander doesn't stop with the conquest of
Persia but then keeps going in, did not start with the justification.
We also hear about lots of other exploits that Alexander engages in.
So, for example, we hear about him sneaking into the court. He puts
on a disguise and sneaks into the court of the Persian king, looks
around, meets different people, meets Darius, his daughter, and
ultimately sneaks back into his army and then leaves the army to
capture Darius's Campbell. We hear about the Persian king Darius
being murdered by his own men and ultimately Alexander to preserve
the bloodline of Persian royalty. He marries Darius's daughter,
Roxana. Now, in history, Roxann was not the daughter of the king. She
was the princess of a different group of people entirely. But here
we're conflating some geography and history after this, after he
marries into the royal family and the Persians are destroyed or
conquered, rather. He ends up doing something completely different.
He travels around and this is where we fully develop this idea of the
quest for knowledge philosophy from the first book, he travels around
trying to learn things. He wants to know how the world works. So he
travels around, he sees and meets all of these magical animals and
places and peoples. He travels up to the stars, like I mentioned in
the last at the very end of the last lecture. It's a chair that he
hitches to a series of Griffins and they carry him up into the
heavens so he can get a closer look at the stars. He sits in a giant
glass diving bell and descends to the bottom of the ocean so he can
see what's there. Again, none of this happened, but it's developing
this idea of a character trait that is defined by interest in the
world, the pursuit of knowledge and philosophy, not conquest in the
course of this. What's really developed here is that his quest for
knowledge ultimately leads to a quest for the ultimate form of
knowledge, which is immortality. Now, have we seen a quest for
immortality before where? So this is very directly playing on some of
these much older traditions, not in the world, but we can see here
the pulling in of other cultural traditions to into this narrative.
But now this is the story from the first two books and only three
books and the The Romance of Alexander. This is the basic storyline.
Now, the reason I say take the history with a grain of salt is
because everything in blue did not happen historically. So there's a
lot that has been inserted into the story. And there's no single
author here that has just made stuff up. All of this is the result of
centuries of folklore, of tradition and fables being built up around
Alexander, but are ultimately being interpreted as history here. And
we see that two foot three. So. We have a diminished class, but I'll
still try to ask you guys to go through the narration for me. Where
do we where do we pick up the story? What happens first? Yeah, so we
start in India, that's a very short battle to conquer the entire
subcontinent of India. There is enough in here. That kind of it makes
me think of the battle of mindspace, which is a historical battle.
It's one of several against the kingdom of. But it's there's not
enough in here to make it actually be the battle of the space. So
it's we're conflating not completely collapsing, a lot of different
battles and a lot of different campaigns and actions into one there
to make it a little more streamlined. This is also why we have porous
being, I think, 10 feet tall, Alexander being five feet tall. This is
playing some of the contrast between the different kingdoms in the
different peoples. All right, so he conquers India and just right
here at the beginning of the book, he sets out and actually
accomplishes and fulfills the only mission that he still has. So this
frees him up to do anything else that he wants to do for the entire
rest of America. And what does he do? Because the bonds or the bonds
there are more isolated and nothing, this goes to a lot of questions
and. Yeah, so after he has become the conqueror in the in the earlier
book, he alternates between conqueror and philosopher in search of
knowledge. And so here we have the same thing. He has conquered and
now he can be the philosopher. Yet he only fights when he has to. And
when he's done fighting, he's done. This is not the Alexander of
history. The. Alcoholic anger probably conquers the world. This is a
very different picture of Alexander, so here he's going and he's
talking to Brahmins, who are these? And Greek thought it has nothing
to do with the religion of India. It has to do with a philosophical
class effectively. That's what the of class of philosophers who are
dedicated to searching for ultimate knowledge. There's this tradition
of Greek philosophy trying to understand what the pyramids are all
about. Very brief period. We're very interested in the province. It's
kind of interesting how they interpret Romans and this is playing on
that tradition. So the Romans have knowledge that Alexander once and
so he goes to them and the way that he talks to them is very telling.
This dialectic style, it's Socratic method as well. It's the way that
students and teachers would talk to each other in a classroom as one
of the teachers and students ask each other questions. And through
very simple back and forth question and answers, they ultimately try
and tease out some deeper truths. And that's what he's doing here. So
he's both the teacher and the student to these these Romans. We'll
come back to that. So after he goes to the province in search of
philosophical truth, where does he go that? Trees, prophetic trees,
oracular trees. This does sound kind of strange, but there are
actually there is a tradition in every religion of oracular trees.
There are oak trees that whisper the words of Apollo, the oracle of
the doughnut. So this is fully within the great tradition. So he's
hearing from this oracle about his faith and about the future after
he learns of his future. It makes him want to go even further afield
and meet other people and learn new things. So who does he go to
next? And so. Or Semiramis of a Syria. It's confused, both names are
used and they're not the same person who goes to Queen will be the
group is actually a title means queen, specifically a warrior queen
in the kingdom of Kush. Here, the title becomes the name of the
Queen, but she's also referred to as Semiramis, which is a completely
different queen in the Assyrian period from hundreds of years
earlier. And I think the tradition of two powerful queens somewhere
to the south and or east has become conflated here. But but Kandak is
now the queen of City of Marylee. Otherwise the kingdom of Kush, lots
of different names here, floating names of places floating around
that ultimately it's the same area. This is a very powerful
historical kingdom just to the south of Egypt that remain independent
for the most part from the Greeks and the Romans after this. So it
has this tradition that extends back to the time of Alexander and is
still around in one form or another when the romance is being
compiled. And so it goes to kind of does things down there. Has some
detours saved her sons and ultimately. Does he learn anything from
kind of. Yeah, he has learned some humility, not a not a deep
knowledge. It's not like when he meets the Brahmins and he's
searching for philosophical truth. He's just learning humility in
this case on his way back. He hears from a different oracle about his
state again. So we have this recurring theme of learning faith and
moving through one's destiny that we should fully recognize from
Roman tradition. And then he, after this, has gone on this quest and
now he needs a new quest, something new to do. And what does he do
here? I don't want to keep calling on you. The right. He needs a new
people to conquer. We've learned some things now he needs to conquer.
So it leads an army against the Amazons. Historical people, but the
Greeks really interpreted them to live up to the north of Central
Asia. And so we're we're moving around here. I'll come back to what
he does with the Amazons later after this, he ends up writing a
letter home to his mother, which effectively recaps everything that
has just happened in Book three. There's a lot of redundancy here.
After this, writes another letter to his mother that ends up going
from leaning against Amson over and he ends up narrating an
assassination plot and ultimately ends up narrating his own death to
his mother. Obviously, this cannot happen either. But he narrates his
own death, culminating in his death. And shortly after this, the part
that I didn't give you to read is what happens after he dies, because
it gets really confusing. I know the history here and it was kind of
hard to follow. What ends up happening is you have his will being
read, which was not done historically is Will is read and it's really
self-contradictory. Different portions of the will as presented in
the romance, contradict other portions and ultimately support pretty
much any construction of history that you want to look forward to
construct. And then at the very end of the book, his life is recap.
So this is the narrative here until we get to the very end, it's
fairly straightforward, redundant, even in case we missed anything,
you can just go to the letters and figure out what you've missed. Now
also should be taken with a grain of salt. Everything in bloom is
either not historically attested or did not happen the way that it
is. And the romance, possibly the battle to hide Aspies at the
beginning and then his death at the end and everything else in the
middle is fully coming from that folklore tradition, establishing him
as a philosopher, not as a. All right, let's try to have a discussion
again, pared down, but let's talk about this kind of romance shows a
breaking down of the difference between history and fable, history
and course, the the point of the historiography. Remember that the
historic tradition that is rewriting history was to present a
narrative that was educational. Libby, for example, was not trying to
tell everything that happened in history. He's telling us he's using
Roman history to make a philosophical and moral point for his
generation of people and those who came after him. That didactic
point, that point of trying to be educational while using history to
make the point that begins to take over the and how earlier events
are presented to a reader. If something fits the narrative that the
author is trying to to present, then it is included in the history.
If something does not fit that narrative, then it's not included at
all. And we can see how over time that would mean that a lot of
things are just dropped from the historical record and they're not
preserved. So through time, this didactic point of historiography
takes over completely. And so different pieces of the story that
might not entirely make sense historically, but fit that narrative
that fit that philosophical moral point are going to be included as
if they were true. So let's think back on what we've read before, the
non epics. What would it take to turn these earlier non epics into
epics? Think about the Hellenistic literature. About art in our
custody. The one about the stars and about the fish. What would it
take to turn that or those into epics? Think about Roman lit like
Libby, what would it take to turn Libby into an epic? And then think
about the alexandrite, what would it take to turn it into an. So
break up in groups, let's take a couple of minutes. Well, for more on
that, let's listen. Out of. Lot. Or is it? And as part of our. And
that is how all. There is more. Did you get. But I want you. And.
Michael. What we all know is that it's possible that of the. All
right, I'll take the law as a good stopping point. But you guys came
up with a certain amount, the artist and his account of the
phenomena, the things that can be seen and is the stars and the
weather patterns and things like that. What would it take to turn
artists or our customers so the fish guy into an epic? Basically up a
lot by having a law, there is nothing to follow. It's just it's.
Yeah. Literally any stringing narrative plot. Yeah. Yeah. Anything
else? And that's pretty much plot. There's there's nothing there
because what we have in these earlier traditions is pretty clear
distinction between the history, which is still educational, still
moralistic, philosophical. Then there's the epic, which is kind of
similar intentions, but written in a very different style and in the
folklore, which is what artists in protests just really drawing on.
There's not there's overlap, but not a whole lot. These traditions
are still very separate. What about Roman lit like in living? What to
take to turn Libya into an epic that we're so arrogant that some of
its ability to focus on one liners is one person in this room sort of
a different. Never want to go in on that is one out there. Yeah, we
cut out a few of the names and places that anyone else. Yeah, I think
streamlining it just a little bit, you would get you basically put it
into poetic form epitaph to be called at this point in time. That's
right. There's a lot of overlap between history and epic, especially
in the Roman tradition. But then you have the folklore, which is
still very different. There's a lot of the fantastic and unbelievable
elements. The mythology doesn't really make it into the epics or the
history. That's still very, very separate. The Alexander romance I
want to take to turn this into an epic. Well, we found that in most
of the cases it or for it doesn't seem to follow along with the
experts. It just doesn't seem to be going the other way. It does feel
like it's an area which counts, but it just doesn't have that kind of
flavor to it. Now. Anyone else? It's a good story, but it has no
significant. We're seeing there's one goal to get through the end of
the quarter. Alexander does something for that. And I. And that's
why. You might not enjoy the next epically great, great, it's. Leave
it there. Yeah, he flits around a lot, there's a lot that you have to
kind of clean up a little bit, you have to put it in poetic form.
You'd have to polish it a bit, maybe a bit more in some places than
others. But otherwise, it's I mean, the story line is basically
they're already right. The way that we deal with which philosophy,
the way that we deal with with moralizing and philosophical points,
it's there. So what we see here, by this point in time, all of these
different traditions have gotten kind of blurry. Everything has been
pulled into a single narrative. And through that one narrative, we're
branching out into all of these other traditions, all of these
historical traditions, all of these philosophical traditions, all of
these folklore motifs that are just being pulled in to document that.
Remember what is happening with Nonis, all of these different
histories, all of these different groups of people, all of these
different mythologies are being pulled into a single basic storyline
about Dionysius going off and then coming back. It's a very basic
storyline, but then decorating all of that is this other stuff. It's
this entire other layer of knowledge that's intended to all be pulled
into one single narrative. I think what we see with the Alexander
romance is something very similar. It's a fairly simplistic
narrative, but decorating this narrative is everything else. And so I
think it is possible to read the romance as if it were epic. It's
not. But we can kind of do that because of the way that all of these
different traditions at this point and the late, late, Roman late and
not quite early medieval, but the late antique tradition here, the
way that everything gets kind of conflated together, I think we can
read it as if it were an epic and it'll set the stage for what you
guys read last Byzantine. All right. So if we think about how it's
written, do we have a narrator? Hard to tell. Really. Sometimes if
you Google this and I only say if you Google this, because I can tell
from some of them in terms of people, Google authors, some with more
success than others, the sometimes you Google the get pseudo
callisthenics as an author. It's not that's an old idea that no one
actually believes anymore. It's not listening. And I actually don't
think there's one author. I think that's one of the reasons we get
some of the narrative being confused. Sometimes I think there are
lots of narrators, perhaps too many variables. So like when we hear
about the assassination plot, the plot to kill Alexander, the reason
it kind of I don't know how closely you guys read it, but it kind of
falls apart in places because the same person takes both sides or
it's not entirely clear which side one person is on or who they're
working with, because the same basic storyline is being told from
different points of view. In some cases, the will that is read, that
is self-contradictory. The reason it's self-contradictory is because
there are so many different versions of Alexander's will floating
around in the ancient world. Some of them give the island of Rhodes
complete autonomy and freedom from any other kingdom. Some of them
reinforce Ptolemy's claim to rule Egypt. Some of them reinforce
Ptolemy's claim to rule Babilonia, which he never did. But these
different versions of the will are created afterwards to justify
different outcomes. And it's as if these different traditions that
they compile from different sources and just sort of mashed together
without really any single person taking the time to edit it all for
clarity. We see the same thing here, there are other internal
consistency, so like the simplest Alexanders or sties, historically
Bucephalus did die in India. There's an entire city named kefala in.
I guess it's not an attack, but then in the story, Bucephalus comes
back to life on Alexander's deathbed or right after he dies, as
everyone is fighting over Alexander's kingdom, as the horse comes
back to life and then also somehow talks and tries to be the voice of
reason. And this kind of very truncated council scene here, it
doesn't make sense. It's fantastic. But it's also internally
inconsistent, as if these different traditions were being mashed
together and the rest of geography didn't even try to figure out
where exactly these different things were when they were happening. I
like maps, so the first time I read this, I made a map of what was
happening. It's very confusing. Sorry, this is the map I showed
earlier. This is not my I this year. So I'm going to this is is the
actual today. He left the capital of Macedonia and he moved through a
lot of that turkey down along the coast into Egypt, back through
Mesopotamia and down. Up through. Modern day Iran wiping out the
vestiges of the Persian Empire process, and they continue, as you're
sort of wondering, to see what's there ending up in modern day
Afghanistan, wandering around, conquering Bactrian in something, and
then down across the Indus River, into Pakistan, at least into
Pakistan, possibly India, before turning around, coming back. And
ultimately died in that one. That's the historical. We have to
actually zoom out to get the Alexander Romans here, the romance
edition of The Geography. We start in India and when he wants to go
visit the leaves India and somehow meets up with her son, who is
going to attack the in Asia Minor. So he goes up on that and then
within the span of about to go from here to somewhere here in the
back. There's a lot of geography covered there. He needs kind of he
does what he does and what at that point was called Ethiopia. Today
it's going to be the northern Sudan. Then he returns to Egypt, to the
Oracle, the oracle of Omaha here. That makes sense to. Oh, I should
mention the question mark over here, it's not because, frankly, it's
because we don't know who these meetings he's meeting the Syrian in
the Syrian city, if need any, which seems to be more what's less plot
or so its location is also somewhat unknown. All right. So then
returns via Egypt and then he decides to go conquer the Amazon or
meet with the different traditions. Different. So it means Egypt,
traditionally, the Amazons are not even in great thought, although if
there are, there's a place name given when you cross the river. That
river is over here. So the geography again gets a little bit
confused. You can't the Amazons. And then this is where things get a
little more confusing. He then leads wherever the Amazon are and goes
down to the killers, apparently, which traditionally are over here.
It's the strait that separates Spain from Morocco in other
traditions. It's the modern Strait of Hormuz, which makes a lot of
sense. So we can imagine that here. Then in the next scene, he is
somehow back up at the Black Sea and then he's down here on the
Arabian Gulf and then he's up here in the Hindu Kush, meaning men
living up in the Himalayan mountains. And then ultimately, he ends up
back in the middle of it. Now, none of these are given consistent
placements. You have to kind of read between the lines. You have to
make some guesses. But this appears to be the map. It's wildly
impossible, impractical, if nothing else, because I think we can
safely assume that the geography is not the point. This person and
whoever is writing this order and compiling it is not trying to make
the geography be consistent. What they're trying to do is put these
different stories together roughly in some form that looks vaguely
chronological so that we can get this idea of Alexander Splendens
everywhere he goes, every person he meets, every group of people he
meets, he has to be the smartest one in the room. It has to be
clever. And even when he is shown up, like when he needs kind of
smarts him, he still has to do something to redeem his value of
cleverness. That's why he brings peace among her sons. He has been
outsmarted and then put in his place. But he still has to do
something else to show that he is still clever and smart. So the
geography is not the point. But in this kind of confused geography,
we can still see something about what people, especially in Greece at
this point in time, are thinking about the world. So all of this in
trying to emphasize Alexandra's cleverness, we do see some things,
some influence of very early ideas. This confused geography also goes
along with occasional references to Christianity. So with help from
Providence above, for example, that's actually in the Greek, too.
This is not an early idea. This is purely coming from Christianity.
We see some other older traditions that are being changed at this
point in time. So the Amazons are no longer existential threats to
all things Greek as they are in the classical period and the
Hellenistic period. Now they're very human fighting. Amazons is
feudal, right? They're humanised. They're presented as this entire
other kingdom that Alexander can rationalize with, can reason with,
can establish a treaty with, which is never something that you see in
older classical works. And then we talked last time about this this
idea of race and skin tone in Nonis and how what was being translated
in Nonis does not actually reflect what the people in Alexandria, in
Nonis Day in the four hundreds were thinking. Here we see this being
reflected very differently. Queen Kandak apologizes for her people
skin color in a way that we would never see earlier. So this is a
collapse and a shrinking of the world, understanding of the world and
its people and who are in it. And all of this is coming from the
source literature. It's mostly fables. There are histories and
biographies of Alexander. Some of them Arean and other cyclists wrote
histories, accounts of Alexander's campaigns. Plutarch wrote a
biography of Alexander. All of them are drawing on these first hand
accounts on a secretase was, as I said, an admirable saying,
admirable, admirable. In Alexander's army, who wrote an account of
his life and his campaign's ghastliness was an ambassador that
Alexander sent to the Maori king in India. And all of these guys
wrote accounts of what they were seeing, what they understood. This
is very recent history to me. And these later histories and
biographies are drawing on that. But what we see in the romance is a
very late idea, drawing on the fables more than anything else. So
that's why we get the shrinking world view or the geography and the
people and the details are much less important than the figure of
Alexander himself. And as I said at the beginning, this idea of
history is itself a little bit tricky. The earlier biographers of
Alexander, these earlier chroniclers, they themselves weren't always
necessarily the most reliable. So we get Plutarch writing the life of
Alexander. And I say this because the Romans considered it to be
authoritative, to be right. This this little story on the secretase.
And the story is told that many years afterwards, on a secretase,
reading aloud the fourth book of his history. When, which is the tale
of the Amazon versus Alexander going to the kingdom of the Amazon,
and in this tale and on a secretase tradition, Alexander goes to meet
with the queen of the Amazon and have a one to one philosophical
dialogue with her. He's reading this in the court of Senecas, who is
himself a king at this point in time. One of Alexander's former
generals and Civicus listens to the whole story and then smiles
gently and on a syncretism. Where was I when all this is happening?
So people are very aware in this first generation after Alexander's
death that the histories and the stories are not actually what
happened, but they're willing to go with it just to satisfy the
appetite for stories about his life and what happened. They're very
aware of what happened, but they like the stories to. And it's not
just with Alexander, it's this general idea of this new world that
Alexander has opened up, the Plutarch talking about someone else
talks about how geography is crowded on the outer edges of their maps
in the parts of the earth, which elude their knowledge, explanatory
notes about what lies beyond the sandy desert without water, as in, I
couldn't go here because it's a desert and we didn't have enough
water or it's full of wild beasts, as in we were scared to go there,
or it's a blind marsh that people can't live in, or a city in cold or
frozen sea. It's inhospitable. And I didn't go here so there'd be
monsters here or I just didn't bother. And this is what Plutarch is
saying. The outer edges of the world are. This is what people also
wanted to know about. And if people aren't going to these places and
seeing them, all they have to rely on are these legends and fables
that quote that I gave you at the beginning. When the legend becomes
fact, the legend have centuries of these stories growing up about
these fabulous adventures at the corners of the map that no one has
ever seen. And slowly over time, that's what becomes the history. So
we see the knowledge of the world geography, its people declining
somewhat, quite a bit, but we also see this this figure of Alexander
changing, becoming less warlike, becoming something rather different,
because we have this idea throughout the Roman world, which you guys
have seen or is balance. It's it's noble, but only to a point. When
should we be fought? You remember? According to Virgile or stations,
one, should war be fought? Defensive war should be fought to defend
your home or your people should not be fought in Congress. That's the
Roman ideals, the nobility of war that is being portrayed there, this
whole argument in Lukan about just war, you guys didn't read that
part when we talked about a class that's coming out. And during this
time, it's really being developed during this time. So what do you do
with a figure like Alexander, who is a world conquered? You can't
ignore him entirely because the empire he conquered changed the
course of the world for a huge swath of geography and then hundreds
of thousands, if not millions of people. You can't ignore that. So
this is what the the ideas are at the time, you can't ignore him, you
have to change him. You have to change the history understanding to
fit the new realities which we saw with Kolba and also and so this
Socratic dialectic with this philosophical dialogue with the
Brahmins. It reflects this changing reality, so we see that gods and
religion are still important, but so is what happens in life. This is
pretty easily understandable in a Christian context. It's also
understandable in a pagan context. It's understandable in a in a
Zoroastrian context in modern day Iran. It's understandable in other
religions as well across a broad swath of culture and religion. We
hear about humans and kingship being inherently unjust and corrupted
Brahmins. Talk about this. Alexander questions this with Darius
before Darius is killed. We've seen this before and Lukan and
stations as well. And then we have this idea of rejecting worldly
concerns in order to find peace and happiness in what we have simple
pleasures of life instead of being a king or being a conqueror. And
this is coming straight out of Hesiod, these old ideas, new ideas
being reinvented to reflect a very new reality. And as I said,
they're very similar ideas floating through various cultures and
religions that make up the known world at the time doesn't just fit
the new Christian reality of Greece and Europe. It fits other places
as well. And what we're also presented with through these new
moralities and new realities is this new model of a hero, not a hero
in the old tradition, but a hero in a folk tradition. And this is
important to remember for what you guys read next. So let's think
about that hero. What do we see in Alexander? I mean, obviously,
Alexander is the hero. What define him? What qualities? Define it.
Intelligence, it has to be the cleverest person around always.
Curiosity about what? Yeah, everything right, how the world works,
how the world is structured, what things look like that you can't see
normal. That's why he takes Griffin's up into this into space. That's
why he takes a diving bell to the bottom of the ocean. His conquest
play much of a role. Military virtue. Leadership of men, battle is
always brave, is doing things that are inadvisable because of this
program. Where are his men during any of this? Do we hear about any
of his army? Many of his generals. I know you're the one who comes
with them. Is there any one guy out of tens of thousands in his army?
We don't really have a picture of what his army is doing or where
they are or why. For the most part, they're not important. All the
focus is on Alexander. So these old ideas of leadership really aren't
there anymore. It's this personal accomplishment. In some ways it's
closer to what we might see or expect in the Iliad or the Odyssey
instead of in these Roman epics. So he has to be clever. He has to be
the smartest one in the room, but at the same time we have this this
realization, or rather he demonstrates a realization that he is also
inferior to other people. That's why he goes and seeks the wisdom of
the province. That's why he wants to go back to Connecticut. That's
why he wants to go seek the men in the in the Himalayas. He knows
that he does not have certain knowledge that other people do. And he
wants to have that knowledge, too. But he also has to prove to them
that he's worthy of that knowledge and that he is ultimately superior
because it's clever. So it's this odd mix of personality traits here
because everyone likes an underdog. You want to root for an underdog
and the way that you don't want to root for a world conqueror who is
kind of conceited or has an anger problem. Everyone likes an
underdog. So the narrative really, really tries hard to make him the
underdog. And that's why we have this constant refrain that he
recognizes that he lacks something, recognition that he is in some
way inferior to the other people that he needs. And yet, in the end,
all of these meetings come out with him on top. And this is another
thing that we're going to see this mix of inferiority and
superiority. We're going to see this another and the other folk hero
that you guys are going to meet next time. He's brave and strong and
capable. He doesn't rely on other people to do things. He does
everything himself. This is why we don't see his army. Everything he
does, he does himself. He scouts and visits other people, other
places. Even the kings and queens himself sneaks into the camp. He
meets on the field of battle challenges for us to single combat. And
in this tradition, this is how he wins the battle by killing us on
the battlefield. In reality, for us, did not die, of course, became
Satara. Battle came for him. But this is how it feels for us. He
scouts the territory of Queen Canongate by himself, and there is a
brief, fleeting attempt to show that he still, in spite of all of
this happens, that this columnist recalls them in the middle of
battle. Fellow soldiers. But that's about it. That's all we hear
about as soldiers. The focus is on him being very clever
philosophically. It's not just that he's smart. It's not just that he
has knowledge. It's that he's clever to use that knowledge to try and
set traps for other people, either physical trapped or he's going to
kill us, or rhetorical traps where he's trying to maneuver this
diplomatic negotiation with the Amazons to benefit him. And yet, in
spite of all of this, in spite of its cleverness and its philosophy,
it can also be a tested and we hear learning from the Brahmins we in
learning humility, at least from from conduct, while also being a
teacher. And he's not just going here as a student again, he has to
to have this mix of inferiority and superiority. So we have him being
a student while simultaneously teaching these other people the same
groups that he's learning from. He's also teaching. It's all of this
really serves to emphasize his quest for knowledge and philosophy,
but also why he's doing all of this. He beats all of his adversaries,
not with not with strength, but with cleverness. So he defeats in
combat, but he defeats Boris in single combat and thus defeats his
entire army. When Alexander killed Boris, his army is actually losing
the battle in this narrative. And it's only by killing Boris in
single combat, which he knew he could do that he saves his army and
his battle. He is sort of duel of wits with the Brahmins and kind of
inconclusively. But he defeats the fabricates this tribe in Turkey,
this Gallic tribe, and he doesn't lay siege to the town, but he
doesn't take the town with an army. He incites the townspeople inside
the fortification to rise up and overthrow the king of son. He
manages the reconciliation with the Amazons, the kind of negotiates
and the peace instead of conquering them. So he's always emphasising
his cleverness. And I think the reason that this character trait
comes in. Is because there's this lingering memory of him having
great success on the battlefield because of his strategy, because he
is a clever general in history and these later in these earlier
accounts of history are still being read at the time. They're just
not quite as popular as romance. But there is this memory and
understanding that he was a very clever and successful general and
this idea of him being really clever battlefield transforms into him
being a really just generally clever person in all other areas of his
life. And what do clever people do? Well, they want to go out and
understand things if he is clever in all other areas of life. He must
be doing what all other clever people in this society are doing,
which is going out and talking to people, learning things about the
world and how it works, talking to philosophers and learning what
they think about the world. And this is how he ends up being
transformed, I think, from conker into stage roaming the world for
information. And this is where we come back to his travels. That kind
of confused geography that stretches all the way from here to here
and from here to here, it actually maps really well, not with
Alexander doing anything in his life. It maps really well with all of
the various traditions about his life. I don't know if you noticed,
but this isn't just the Alexander romance. It's the Greek Alexander
romance. It's one of many different traditions that talk about the
life of Alexander. And all of these traditions don't agree on
everything. Actually, there are a lot of things that are very
different in the Greek romance. He spend a lot more time out in India
and up here than he does in, for example, the Persian and Indian
version of the romance, the Hebrew version of the romance. Alexander
goes and pays homage to the temple in Jerusalem, which he does not do
in any of the other accounts. So these different accounts are very
regional and very tailored to their audiences. And if we plot these
on a map. It creates this kind of continuum of different stories that
are all linked into this one guy that stretch from Central Asia down
to Central Africa and from India all the way up into Europe. And it's
this continuum that is trying to tie himself into. By tying himself
into this Alexander tradition, he can find some point of commonality
with anyone else from where he is out there on this map all the way
over in Europe or Central Asia or Central Africa by tying himself
into this tradition and ties himself into this much larger legacy.
That all of these different groups of people are using to to situate
their own history and their own identity and sense. It's an
interesting way to to to structure history and to structure the past,
it has nothing to do with Alexander being Greek. It just means that
all of these different people are structuring their own stories using
Alexander has that one streamlined narrative in the way that Nonis
was using ISIS to streamline all of history into this one. Simple. So
many questions. And he's been there, wasn't sure where where we went
back down there. What was it that actually started back in the
eighteen hundreds? You have a resurgence of scholarly interest in the
ancient literature as opposed to just very popular interest, popular
interest, dissatisfied with the romance for hundreds of years. And
then as time goes on, in the late 18th, early 19th century, you have
scholars looking at the romance thinking this is ridiculous. I want
to know what actually happened. And so that's when they start to go
back to arean Plutarch. Especially I think Aryan was also known at
that time, and they're beginning to read the more historical
accounts, the more cut and dry versions of what happened. And then in
the course of the middle 19th century, the archaeology, especially as
part of the world that comes in and begins to learn material support
for some of the stories in those narratives. And so that really
drives the resurgence of interest in the historical figure. Any other
questions? All right, that's all I have, but I want to ask you guys a
question before I let you go. It occurs to me as well that. I've
never canceled class before a break just because it's a break, but I
have two sections of this class in the second one goes into the early
evening. And judging by the fact that nine people in class right now,
I'm not assuming the class is going to be lightly populated next
Tuesday. So would anyone object to not having class on? Yeah, I've
gotten a few emails to that effect, too, so I figure that works OK,
this means that we would just push to get things back in the Guinness
Book of Records. It's the last thing we would push that back into the
week. We get back that last day of class, which means we don't have
much of a review date because. OK, so in that case, I'll see you in a
week and a half. Have a good time.</p>

<h3 class="western"><a name="_qnrujjy0r39o"></a>Digenis Akritas 4</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"> All right, let's go and get started. I
seem to have forgotten my roster, so everybody gets attendance for
tonight. Now, I know it's a clever strategy. All right. So this is a
last effort, obviously, to talk about this. It's a little bit
different. I remember mentioning this to a colleague in my department
first time. I thought this class was going to have to go. Well, the
other class read this and he just kind of give me this weird look at
why no one reads this outside of Greece. People read it all the time
in Greece, but that's not a great read. What do you guys think of it?
I really did last time I thought this was going to get me. It's a
it's an interesting epic. And I like I mean, the story's different,
but for by a wide margin, the most interesting book, other books,
five and six are really uneven and kind of broken and don't always
make the most sense internally, like there's some logical
inconsistencies there. But also what begins as part of it's kind of
interesting. I should point out what it means. Any sacrifice. It's
not a personal name. It kind of is. But this is sort of two things.
So that's why you're on the cover page here translates as to let it
be born of two worlds, literally. His father is is a Muslim
Baudrillard's. His mother is the daughter of a Byzantine Christian
waterwork. So he gets one foot in both worlds there. And then there
is a boardwalk, someone who has a feudal estate on a border and is
charged with defending that order. So he's the former lord born of
two worlds, literally. And so everything that he does is in that that
vein. That's in that cultural context. Why is it people? And so what
I like about this, what I like about him being here, is that we kind
of come full circle because again, this is part of an oral tradition.
There are oral songs still sung about beginnings today in Greece. And
just because I can. Let's listen to one. Here, it's not really the
most melodic song, there's that kind of liora, so it's a specific
type of lyric from a part of Turkey called Pontoise. Sit in on your
knee, play it vertically, Calica. Glossolalia, we talked about
earlier in the semester and he's singing a song. It's very
repetitive. I don't know if he taught the word octopus the very first
word there. This is a living tradition and I'll give you the CD from
which this is drawn if you guys want to go check it out. This is a
living tradition, a living oral tradition, just like what we started
with. Gilgamesh wasn't necessarily an oral tradition at that point,
but everything else, the first part of the semester was. So we've
come full circle and it's we call this a critical tradition up there,
and all of these stories are about heroes from the borderlands, from
the design team Borderlands. As the Byzantine borders shrank over the
centuries, there arose a lot of stories about order lords. That is,
feudal lords were tasked with defending the border and also outlaws
who existed in this sort of between lawless states around the
borders. So to understand that, let's look at how we got there. And
it's it's a long, bumpy road. We have to remember the last time we
looked at the Roman Empire, there were actually two Roman empires,
Western Empire and Eastern Empire. Three ninety five on the two do
not mix there. Never joined back again. And this actually works out
pretty well for the Eastern Empire because shortly after this, things
go south real fast because for lots of different reasons, actually,
there's a lot of movement over here in Central Asia that is sort of
just down the line drive over here, begin moving, coming down into
the Persian Empire and in Armenia. And then they try to push, push,
push, push. And it's just this long movement of peoples for. One
hundred years, and so the Western Empire, because of its long exposed
borders, topples. This is one of the main causes of the fall of the
western Roman Empire, was they followed the collapse of the western
Roman Empire, the eastern empire as well. In terms of this, it
borders much more risk, gets ravaged by Constantinople, holds it's
never taken, which means the rest of the empire is relatively safe.
And it's not until much later, when other wars began happening in
other fronts, that the Byzantine Empire begins to shrink. And it does
shrink. So when we look at the eastern Roman Empire, we have to
understand that even though it's from Rome, from Constantinople, it
is Roman, the people there consider themselves Roman. They call
themselves Roman. But break their idea of Roman culture was very
different from, say, Virgile or the Emperor Augustus's 600 years
earlier. But they still considered themselves Roman. On this map
here, the visiting are state colored most of North Africa into the
patchy land holdings in Italy, but it begins to shrink because the
eastern empire has its own pressures in its relatively wealthy. This
is the older half. The old Roman Empire cities in this part of the
world are already old, ancient, wealthy. By the time the Roman Empire
was founded, but it has a lot of borders. It does not have many
secure borders and all of its borders over the course of several
centuries are attacked and chipped away at. So that shrinks pretty
quickly by around a thousand. The eastern Roman Empire is confined to
mostly Greece and again and in modern day, Turkey still has a couple
of territories and that's about it. And this very long series of
contractions of the borders as the Byzantine gets the same thing as
the Roman world here shrinks. That's the setting for the. That's the
borderland that began with them. So this this epic is set somewhere
in the jump again. We are looking at late antiquity, as in the four
and five hundreds. Now we're looking at the eight hundreds and nine
hundreds. And now I'll get to that set here. I'll get to that in a
few, but it's set in this time period when the Byzantine Empire, the
Roman Empire, it's pretty cosmopolitan. It still has landholdings
around the Mediterranean. Its capital, Constantinople, draws in
trade, diplomats and even mercenaries from all over Europe, North
Africa, the Middle East and even as far away as India. So it's a very
large, cosmopolitan empire, but it's controlled by a very small
number of Greek noble families. These are the small Greek nobility
uses the idea of Greek traditions as kind of a gateway to political
power. So education is restricted to the Greek language, Greek
history, literature. And this is these are things that are essential
for political mobility, for gaining power in this this eastern Roman,
Byzantine world. Now, we've kind of seen this before, the idea of
this over education as a political stepping stone, as a cultural
stepping stone. When did we talk about this with. And the religion of
Christianity and you remember the. One or the other. We'll see where
you're going with this one. One of the main problem is cloning for
DoRight. And the Nonis was also using this older patient past as a
way of talking about his modern culture. And so this process
continues. It's not just limited to that, that transitional period
between paganism Christianity. It continues on through the visiting
period here. But aside from that, the idea of that that classical
tradition, there's not much else that's really the same, because the
way that the organization is now organized into a series of feudal
military governorships, military territories that are designed with
hereditary land holdings to protect the border, that's their only
job. So within the system, these territorial border lords have almost
complete autonomy. And as long as they protect the border, as long as
they give service to the Byzantine emperor, when he calls, they can
do whatever they need to to maintain that border integrity. That's
their only job. This is called the order themselves are the. So the
the border lords themselves are the. So remember the feudal system,
because we're going to come back to this and this is directly
relevant to what the NEA is doing in the epic and who is his father,
Monsta. But it's really these unstable orders that give shape to the
act. It's it's a perennial problem for and they never really figure
out exactly how to stabilize the border. It's not always a long, slow
attraction there, periods of expansion, but overall, it's
contraction. So they got here about one thousand. The epic itself is
set over here just a little bit before this, but set on this border.
They just watch that order, that's around a thousand within about 80
years after this map, the Byzantine world is pretty much broken in
that part of the world so that my twelve hundred, there's not
anything that's going to be border here. So the border is here to
explain a little bit more, but it's retreating out of water, that
turkey, and it's never really going to come back in that area. And by
the time the empire falls, sometime after this map of thirteen
hundred. It's really just Constantinople and territory just outside
of that. All of this has gone. All of this by the time the city falls
to the to the Ottoman Empire in fourteen fifty three. It's just the
city of Constantinople. That's it. So it's a long, slow decline. And
so the history of what the eastern Roman Empire has been, it's always
on the minds of Byzantine. It's always on people's mind as to what
what they once were, what their empire once was, and what could have
happened in that kind of context that we find against. So just to
look at the epic itself, we don't have a whole lot of sources here,
but it's interesting that all of the sources we have are different.
This is not something that has been codified and formalized in the
way that The Iliad or The Odyssey or really most of the other epics
that we've read have that it is as if that oral tradition or just
written down by one scribe who wrote this version and this version
based on that one song that was sung at one time, happened to be
recorded elsewhere. So all of these are from oral traditions. They
tell the same general story, but each version is just a little bit
different. Some of them include stories that the others don't. Some
of them tell the same stories in different ways. This version is from
a monastery called Grotto Fratta. That's why it has that that title
page. It's very short. It's eight books long, but only about thirty
seven hundred lines. This is one of the shorter epics that we've
read. It's written so it's set about the nine hundred or so. The
stories probably begin popping up within a couple of centuries
following that and then it's written down a couple of centuries
following back. So by the time we get to what you guys read, they are
describing a world that has not existed for about four hundred years,
but that old world. But it's still a world that they recognize. Any
questions about this. So let's look at what happens before book four.
It is an interesting setup because it doesn't actually start with the
beginning. It starts with his father, who is a Syrian Amir. This is a
territorial ruler, I guess, who is a client of the sultan of Baghdad.
And the Syrian Amir, who is Muslim, crosses the border on a raid,
kidnaps the daughter of a general and then takes her back. He is
pursued by her brothers who defeat him in battle. And ultimately, he
agrees to convert, cross back across the border and settle in
Byzantium land and become one of these border walls. And that's the
setup. Now, if you remember what kind of scene this sort of thing
before remember Nonis? We read book twenty five, but if you think
about how the epic started, it didn't actually start with an ISIS.
You have seven books that have nothing to do with ISIS because what
it's doing is building the world, setting the stage for his main hero
for a pretty significant period of time. That's kind of what we have
here. We have the set up family, the world building before our main
hero in the. So I to what happened, the basic setup, so we care about
whose property is actually bottle gets confusing. We'll come back to
that. Basil is born near misses at home. This is his family. So he
then travels to Syria and the end of the beginning of a three. He
talks to his mother. He talks to the rest of his family. He converts
them all to Christianity. And then a book for enmasse as a whole
people, they all cross over into visiting territory and settle. So
this means that now beginning Basils future territory is well
populated. It has a thriving economy, but it has some economic base
here. It's not just an impoverished border territory. It's a place
that is relatively substantial. Yeah, and that's the setup for book
for so book four is when the battle comes of age and we hear about
him as an individual and what do we hear him do? First off. He felt
that he was. Yeah. Who does does. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I'm going to get
concerned. Yeah, he wants to go fight beats. He wants to prove
himself. Now, we've seen this before. Animal Fights Gilgamesh did
this. The very beginning of the class is the long story way of
proving yourself. Once you come of age, you make a name for yourself
with these exploits. Did anyone catch what that age actually is, the
12 to 12 year old kid? Twelve year old kid attacking bears with a
stick. It's kind of hard to translate this word, the Greek, it's just
the stick effectively, I think Mace. So the club basically probably
playing on traditions, apparently, but he's attacking animals with a
mace, with his bare hands. He's tearing them in pieces and he's a 12
year old kid. All of this is supposed to be impressive. The exploits
of dignity throughout all of this are quite literally unbelievable.
And they're intended to be that way. So it proves himself with the
animal hunt choses his father and his uncles, how he is now a man in
the society that can take his place in this broader world, take his
place in this kind of lawless cultural landscape. All right. So what
does he do after he proved himself? But they need to hit that just
yet, needs a girl sorry to actually meet her. Really, how do they
meet? Correspond with girls like this one, that before it happens
very quickly. Yeah, there is a bit of a go between mostly to standing
under her window and shouting or playing a song, singing a song, I
think Romeo and Juliet kind of thing here. That's effectively what
this is. And you're right. It's very, very quick. Like within a day
they fall in love and agree to a level and they try this. We should
imagine these are both like 12, 13, 14 year old kids who are eloping
together on a horse. Who is this woman, who is his wife? What's your
name? Do we even know? Yeah, she doesn't have a name, but really
important enough to have a name and it's tradition which is telling
there's a lot of subtle society work in here that will come back to
we don't really know anything else about her except that her father
is the general. She has brothers who are also generals. Her father is
a pretty powerful commander because he sends his entire military
force after. Do you get a sense and her to bring them back, then how
does that go? I mean, this is a 12 year old kid riding a horse away
from an army. We would expect this to go poorly for him. He
slaughters like this, and when the brothers come and it's very
special because it's going to be easy. Yeah, to kill thousands of the
general's soldiers. Just because he can apparently he spares the
brothers because he wants to be nice to its future wife and then
that's really it, he proves himself again with this quite literally
unbelievable military victory that shows the general the potential
worth of future son in law. So based solely on that, the general
agrees that Marzel can marry into the family. Bazzel and whoever the
daughter is getting married, they settle on the border. And again,
this becomes an octopus becomes one of these two baudrillard's, the
general transfers some of the property, some of the territory and
some of the economic land that's going to support this new territory
over to the northeast to be his old fiefdom. So Basil now has a
house. He has a wife. He has a family. The potential for one, at
least he has a name for himself. He has acquired fame within his
family and outside of his family. And this is about as far as I think
I had you guys read after this, it gets kind of confusing because the
emperor of the Byzantine Empire is also named Basil. And the the more
important Basil comes down to meet the order Lord Basil. And it seems
as if sometimes the scribe even gets confused about which Basil he's
describing doing some things. So the two puzzles meet again as Basil
is untrust, distrustful of the emperor of Basil, and so doesn't want
to meet him directly. He's afraid that if he meets the emperor, he'll
be assassinated with good reason. The Byzantine Empire is very
unstable throughout most of this period and very powerful
Baudrillard's border commanders have a habit of rising up in
rebellion. So the Byzantines visiting emperors tend to want to have
these these very powerful, well, very clever border generals. But
they don't want them to be too powerful, too clever so that they
would rise up against the empire. So the government is afraid of
falling into this trap. So he ends up sort of working around the
tricking the emperor to accept him to show off how clever he is
without actually having to to match wits with either directly. And so
by the end here. We have the beginning of the book repeat, so there's
another animal combat not to impress the father and uncles, but this
time to impress the emperor himself. So it's very cyclical. I
wouldn't call it rain composition, but it is kind of repetitive in
that sense. And it ends up with the emperor of &Ouml;zal accepting a
bottle to allow him to rule this border territory. And then the
emperor goes back home and that's it, which is strange. It's not what
an emperor would do, but it just sets up how important beginning's is
going to be subsequently. And it goes on from there. Looks five and
six are frankly very strange. There are internal inconsistencies in
both books that make it kind of feel like there may be compiled from
a couple of different sources. Book five opens with &Ouml;zal
wandering around in Syria, not his own territory. He's not going on a
raid. He's just apparently traveling, which is not something a border
guard would be doing. So I'm not entirely sure how this is supposed
to set up, but he's he's doing this. He comes across a woman, rescues
her, is supposed to take her to to meet her fiance and ends up
sleeping with her and committing adultery. And that's where it ends.
So we see here that that Basil Beginning's is not the best moral
exemplar. He's clever, he's strong. He's brave to a fault, not a
moral example that anyone should follow. And we see this again in
books, sex. We have Bazzel building a home on the Euphrates River.
This is going to be his border territory, except that he already
built that home in book four. So going back and forward in time. But
he's building his home here. Look six. And then while he's doing
that, his wife goes up on a hill, sits under a tree and is attacked
in sequence by a dragon, a lion, a marauding army of bandits. Then
the three generals, the three commanders of this outlaw army, and
then finally an Amazon who basil beginning defeats and then also
sleeps with. So, again, not a moral example, but it illustrates how
powerful he is in spite of his faults. So Book seven comes along. We
finally have a description of Basil's house. It's described as if it
were a palace in the old Homeric style. So we get a description of
the frescoes and the mosaics and all the things that would be
impressive to an earlier age. And then finally, we hear about the
death of his parents. All of that is just a setup where we hear about
Basil taking a bath. He gets sick and eventually dies because of this
bath, which is not the most heroic death. But throughout all of this,
his deathbed, he tells his wife about two, about his life's exploits,
except his wife has known him since he was 12, so she already knows
the story is repeated life accomplishments he denies. And do we have
a catalog of people who pay respects to. This is pretty similar to
the Alexander romance. Remember the letters that Alexander sent back
to his mother in Macedonia? The letters that tell everything that
we've just finished reading even narrates his own death in a letter
back to his mother. And then after he dies, we have all these people
lining up to pay respects and fight over his kingdom in exactly the
same way that we have here. So those same traditions are coming in
here, just transplanted onto the borderlands. Any questions before we
move on to the analysis? All right. I had intended to ask questions,
but I guess I'll just pop that up. All right. So the narrator's
voice, we kind of have a narrator sort of at the very beginning. It
leads me to the first line. We get this line here at once. I will. It
actually translates a little differently than what I have or what you
guys read. And once I will recall for you, that is he is the narrator
remembering the story in his own mind and then telling the audience,
I will recall for you a story about desire for the capital D except
desire. Has a several different translations, it's this idea of
uncontrollable love, love that is destructive and how uncontrollable
and irrational it is, and that's the main theme of this book. That's
the theme that that underlies DNA going off, trying to elope with
this girl that he's just met, marrying into a general family, which
sets the stage for all of these other calamities that are going to
happen after this. It's all due to this irrational, uncontrollable
desire. Which seems like a very traditional thing to think about,
except that it plays out in a way that's very Byzantine and isn't
necessarily all that that classical. And then the rest of the story
after the narrator introduces the theme, the rest of it seems to be
Basil Beginning's singing his own songs about his own exploits. So
looks five three seven. The narrator is not narrating. It's all Basil
being the narrator, as if the narrator himself is not really all that
important. So the narrator only introduced the theme and then
discounts some earlier stories earlier than the earlier heroes that
we encountered in Homer, like Achilleas, for example, the narrator
discounts these to play up again because the singer and those older
traditions aren't the things that are important. It's the new
traditions. Now, where have we seen this before? Narinder introduces
a story, introduces everything that has come before, discounts it so
that you can move on and sing about the thing that he actually wants
to sing. Yeah, probe that we've seen this with Prova, where she is
rejecting her earlier Pagad life so that she can sing about
Christine. Where else seen it? There several things can go. But it
kind of didn't talk about all the earlier stories and then about why
were wrong in those situations. Yeah, introducing the new Roman style
of hero, rejecting the old agreements, Nonis did the same thing with
the same sorts of stories. He's talking about how Perseus and. And
many are not actually heroes, it's just Dionysus that's a hero, and
he's rejecting all of the earlier mythology so that he could
streamline everything into the. So this is an old old technique to
play up the importance of what you're singing about, what you're
writing about. We've seen this before. So the narrator isn't
necessarily the most important one because he wants to leave the
focus on the main subject, the main hero, but in the midst of all of
this, we do actually have a return to some of these oral traditional
styles of writing. We get the short sentences. We get the phrases
confined to single lines. That's in the Greek, too. It's not just in
the English. We do get formulas. We get the phrases like all covered
with Mosaic, all with Mosaic or covered with Mosaic at the ends of a
line to 60 to 70. And it's not just a scribal error where someone mis
copied the line. This is intentional. We get these formulas, we get
some patronymic fathers names being used. We get some some other
descriptions. So we find formulas working themselves back in. It
might not be the most riveting style. It's not Homeric, but we get
the same aural traditional style creeping back in. All right, I'm
going to ask you guys this in terms of the literary background, what
do we see and what jumped out at you as a reference to something that
we've read before? That's where you focus on things. Yeah, yeah, I
think I mentioned this with honesty. As important as Virgil is as a
national epic of the Romans, Virgil is a national epic for Romans who
are reading and speaking Latin and eastern Mediterranean. Greek is
always the language that's spoken, and it's never really as common or
as popular in the eastern Mediterranean. It's still Homer, that's
popular and easy, that's popular. And so that is what the narrator
really references and really well, discounts don't record Homer.
Don't record Achilleas tales or hectors. They're false. And then they
belong to an earlier age when people didn't know what they were doing
and were misguided. But the Venice belongs to the right age. He
embodies the proper virtues and values that people should should
understand. So it's introducing Homer to discount is also using some
of these same same storytelling methods that Homer used. So we get
epic similes, except they're not really quite the same. I like the
one in two forty five. We hear about beginning's riding a horse like
an apple on a tree. Not at all, it's not doesn't really add anything
to the description or an image in your head, it's just the barest
minimum that you can have a simile with when Dick Cheney sings, those
within the House heard the sweet song and they were bemused, as was
Odysseus once went on his ship. He heard the siren song, What's wrong
with this? What was Odysseus doing when he heard the siren song? Now
the sirens are singing their song to draw people into them, the
sirens are monsters. You don't compare the hero and the epic to a
monster. This is not the way that these earlier epic similes would
have been used. They're there because this is what epics are. This is
how the storytelling method is. But the the person singing the story
and then recording the story there, they're probably aware of these
older traditions, but the traditions have changed. It's just not used
the same way anymore. They're operating within the tradition, but
they're not really a part of it at this point in time. And so when we
see these these type scenes, we get rather different interpretations
of different descriptions of we have the animal combat as we would
expect, we have beginning's fighting lions and bears. This would have
been recognizable to an audience at the time who is maybe they
haven't seen the animal hunts in the great circus in Constantinople,
but they're aware that they have it. They're aware of the fact that
lions and bears used to be hunted in the Roman amphitheatres, but not
quite like this. You don't have 12 year old kids with clubs
attacking. There's a reference to here attacking a lion with a club
in Amam lion was killed that way. But this isn't really how it's
done. Everything that beginning's does is quite literally
unbelievable to build up how impressive he is as one of these
Baudrillard's. And so as a border lord, it's really that folk
tradition that grows up around the border, that's the most important
thing here in the story, the tradition, these border traditions, but
also other other folk songs that grow up in the same region in the
same time and have very similar themes and moral values. So we hear
about Alexander the Great, the Macedonian who is master of the world
with God's help. This is playing straight into the Alexander romance,
not the Alexander history, but Alexander, the folk hero who was
repurposed as a Christian hero because how else could he have
conquered the world, if not for God's mercy? That's the thinking
behind this. So we hear about the Alexander romance. We hear songs
about other outlaws. So the three outlaw commanders who attack his
wife book. Spoke that seven. Sex on the three outlaw commanders who
attack his wife after their entire army of outlaws kill. These are
the fellow Poppy and the film Poppea, the subject of other songs.
There's this entire song tradition of these three outlaws
specifically. So there are lots of folk tales about these these
outlaws and bandits who are operating within these borderlands, but
are not a part of it either. They are rebelling against authority and
for that rebellion, they are themselves paralyzed. And so we don't
have many songs about the Byzantines like the Byzantine Emperor is
doing great things. We have songs about several layers down that on
the social scale, even those who are rebelling against the empire's
authority, they're the ones who are hairlines. They're the ones who
are the subject of these new folk traditions. And then lastly, we
have lots of love songs throughout the entire event. There are lots
and lots of love songs Beginning sings one outside is his future
wife's window. Once they get married, he sings a love song. At the
wedding, he sings love songs while building their house. He sings
love songs in their house. Even on his deathbed, he quotes some of
the songs that he sings earlier. So there's lots of these more
popular songs that people would have recognized at one point that are
being included in here. Remember epic as a cornucopia. That idea
still still of. But the focus is always on beginning's. Always on the
case, even though the stated purpose is about uncontrollable desire.
Again, this is very bad at controlling his impulses, his desires, but
it's always about the. So what kind of hero is. Would you follow the.
I wouldn't. Well, he's 12. Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Yeah,
there's literally no experience with humans. Yeah, OK, good point.
While. It's like all of the and the stereotypical things here, but,
you know, morally not so great. Yeah, there's lots of infidelity. Is
that a flaw or is that just, like, really awesome? I know what you're
thinking about. Maybe not like that, but what does that show? Let's
try to spin that in a positive light. I mean, the whole point of this
is that it doesn't matter who you the person who is really affected
this. And I mean, if you can read the Baringo for thousands and
thousands of people, imagine what you would think. Yeah. What happens
when the sultan of Baghdad leads his army into your territory? Right.
He doesn't think things through. So with the situation, they're
trying to figure out a more complex plan and he's really wanted that
glory to get it very quickly. This was to do noble deeds before he's
grown because everyone needs to get over it and just, yeah, everybody
tells lines of bare hands when they're grown ups or he has to do that
now because he has to be exceptional, quite literally, unbelievably
exceptional. So dependable. I need someone to judge them on his
actions. And he also says that he doesn't care about life without
them. Yeah, not the best moral example, last year, I got more people
latching on to the positive aspects that I started with the
positives, but we'll get to the negativity. And second, he is
incredibly young at at his oldest, he might be 15. At his youngest,
he's he's 12, we're told. We're not really clear how old he is when
he dies, perhaps in his thirties. So everything that he does, he does
as a fairly young man. We do hear about him being educated. He has
three full years of education, which in this kind of border
environment is actually pretty good. So he's a member of the
nobility, a non nobleman, a commoner would not have had access to
even three years of education. So we know that he's a nobleman, he is
young, but in spite of that, he's fairly strong. It's fast. He's good
at fighting. He can run down wild animals on foot without his horses
in order to kill them or hunt them. He's very, very good at fighting.
He kills thousands of well, he kills a number of enemies and allies
single handedly. But he doesn't just have to kill them. He doesn't
just have to fight. We hear about him being clever as well. Sometimes
he wins by tricking his enemies rather than just killing them and
throw out everything he enjoys divine favor. It is as if he himself
is described as a snake. This is the Archangel Michael, but it gets
point across. He is described as if he is a saint, as if he is a
religious figure, in spite of the fact that he is doing things that
are not particularly religious or that all. Sometimes some of them
are flagrantly sacrilegious. But he has God's favor because if he
didn't, you wouldn't be able to accomplish any of this. That's the
reasoning here. And then we also hear about him being this old idea
of you remember, Catholic cardinals have talked about this with the
Iliad. It's this connection between being good and being beautiful,
that which is good is automatically beautiful, that which is ugly or
evil is automatically ugly and evil. So the qualities go
hand-in-hand, which is why we hear descriptions of beginnings being
what they are. He has big eyes. He has described as blonde and dark
hair, but he has a pale complexion. He is described just like the
icons. He is described as one of these figures because it's this old
idea and updated into a new cultural context. But as you guys said,
it's not all positive, he's also boastful, prideful to a fault is
extraordinarily bad at controlling himself. When he shouldn't fight,
he fights when he should exercise restraint. He doesn't. And he's
very bad at controlling his impulses, his baser instincts. And he
cheats on his wife repeatedly. He kills his his own father in law's
army, which would seem to be a problem for a alert throughout. All of
this is just really bad at controlling yourself. And he is fairly
lawless. If it suits him, he can be an outlaw. He can be a bandit
just like the people he is killing. He can embody the same sorts of
traits that he is using to condemn his enemies. So there's some
hypocrisy here. He's motivated by shame, but also a desire for
personal glory, just like the heroes of old who we've spent a few
centuries now reading about how that world doesn't really apply
anymore. It's it's a relic of a different age that only really leads
to destruction, human destruction. Right. So it's a it's a very
conflicted picture that we get here. And yet it's fully within the
realm. What we've seen in the Alexander X, this idea of a folk hero,
the old and the heroes, the old style of the old ideals like what
we've read about in Homer, they're important for cultural reasons.
This is how you get ahead in business and society. You show your
understanding of what these old virtues are, and yet everyone
recognizes that you can't actually live your life like kill. It just
doesn't work. Probably didn't work back then. It really doesn't work
now. And so we have this new style of hero like what we saw with the
Romans, where the epic hero is now a folk hero. This is why it can
be, again, literally unbelievable because it doesn't really matter.
He doesn't have to be a real person. He just has to embody some of
these general traits that people really wish they themselves had or
really wish someone in their society had because of everything else
that's happening around them. And this is where the tradition comes
in, fills the gap between these old ideals and the new reality of the
Byzantine world. So before we look at history there or rather return
to the history, let's think about the society, let's think about what
picture it is that we've seen in the syncretic tradition. What did
you guys notice about the society? We have a kind of return to some
of the older style of epic when we read Homer, we read Gilgamesh, for
example, there's a lot that we can talk about with the society, but
then we get to Lukan and Spacious and Nonis and we can't really say a
whole lot about the society because that's not the point of the epic
here, though, there's a lot of social stuff happening. What did you
guys notice? Religion, very, very important. You can't really miss
it. And it's perhaps a different version of Christianity than some of
us might be familiar with today. Everything good and bad, all that
comes from God, shame and religion are connected here in a way that
is very intrinsic to the Byzantine worldview. And this allows a lot
of irreligious things have to happen. A lot of these sacrilegious a
lot of these these things that don't really quite make sense, that
should make beginnings be not a hero. They should make him into a
negative character, if not an outright villain. But they don't seem
to matter as long as he has God's grace. And all that's really
required for that to happen is for the narrator to say he has God's
grace. It's kind of a self-fulfilling thing here. So the mass killing
of his future father in law's army, all is forgiven. We'll come back
to life. But yeah, religion can be hugely intrinsic to how the
Byzantine saw themselves in comparison to the rest of the world. They
were a Christian empire in contrast to their neighbors. I feel like
lot of the development of the was based on the idea that we're going
to do what they need. What's the matter with you guys are going in
order? Yeah, life on the border is it's lawless. It's unstable. It's
hard to predict what's going to happen from one week to the next. And
the heroes who live in this realm, who defend the realm, embody those
those same principles. They are themselves unpredictable. They're
horribly destructive. But as long as they defend it, as long as they
hold this territory for the emperor, whatever they do is forgiven
because their one job is to protect the border. What else? Can go up
here, but. Probably the next one, there are things. Yeah, so what are
the women? Basically, they are say, look, I'm not going to do
something. Yeah, yeah, we don't even know the name of his wife,
right? The women in the society are very two dimensional characters.
If they're even characters at all, they are secluded and they live
their entire lives in the palatial houses of these these these border
border commanders. And they only really come out when they're getting
married and they leave this secluded room to seal connections between
families. And this is really important to realize for why the father,
the general, sent his entire army out after his daughter. I mean,
there's some familial. Love here, too, I'm sure, but the marriages
between these noble families, it's a business arrangement, it's it's
kind of clad in romance. It's dressed up as romantic love, but it's
really a diplomatic marriage between two important families to
further the idea of protecting the border, of stabilizing this
lawless and unstable land. So when the news comes along, comes along
and runs away with the general's daughter, he's upsetting that
balance. He's upsetting that potential. The general has to pursue
beginnings. Yes, it's his daughter, but he also has to reassert
control over this land. So, yeah, that that ties in here. And we kind
of have to understand how that's all working in order to understand
what the general is doing or rather what the generals really do.
Right. So this is basically how the nobleman and noble women lived.
If you're a commoner, how are you living? What's your life like if
you're not a noble person or a member of a noble family? You're a
soldier, yeah. Is your life worth much? Not much, no, no. This is how
beginning's. Can kill thousands and no one really cares if he kills
these these thousands. It's not even a number that's given. It's just
thousands killed. All of these soldiers who be his future father in
law has paid, trained. Presumably he knows at least a few of them.
And then he goes up to the general, his future father, and says,
forgive me, master, don't send me your troops are Clontz. The way
they fight the Greek is a little more explicit. They're idiots. They
don't know what they're doing. They're untrained in the way that they
fight. And therefore, most of them have gone to hell. Kind of harsh,
not I kill most of them because they're bad at fighting, but they're
bad at what they're doing, they're bad at serving you and therefore
they belong in hell. That's the idea here. Again, everything is
forgiven as long as the border is secured. And if you're not securing
the border, if you're bad at fighting, if you're bad at defending, if
you're bad at serving your futile order, Lord, you have no place in
the society you belong in. Hell is the idea here. And we also hear
about how they are transferred as property when Dignity's gets
married, we have servants, soldiers, slaves and farmers all being
transferred from the general to the Chinese as property at the
wedding. These are not slaves. These are the people who live on the
land. This is part of the feudal system. They are considered property
that transfers with the land from one person to another, from one
border to another, from one empire to another. If you're a poor
farmer living on the land, it probably doesn't really matter to you
all. That much to your border is whether they serve the emperor in
Constantinople or the caliph in Baghdad probably doesn't matter to
you all that much. Your life isn't really going to change because
you're perceived basically as property. So not good to be a commoner
in the society. The feudal nobility, the landowners, the time they're
the ones who are important. They're the ones that are. And this is
why we get such an emphasis on them in the epic week, this is why we
know about Kabasele. This is the model who has his his parents are
who their parents are. This is why we get this genealogy introduced
in the EPIC. And we've kind of seen vestiges of this in an earlier
Epic's to where who you are in the world, as established by your
genealogy, really affects how you fit into it. The Greeks and Romans,
to a different extent, would relate themselves to other people in the
world through these genealogies. So we see this here, and this is how
Basil fits into this border with one side of the family on this side
over here and the other family in both rooms, as we know from the
genealogy. And that landscape is important. Again, pay attention to
that there, that's the original landscape. The stories are written
down around nine hundred. When that landscape is relatively stable,
it's being stabilized through this system of. Border territories,
border lords beginning like his father in law, like the American, and
it's in that relatively stable landscape that the stories are set.
The stories are spread orally in song form as the territory they lost
the ability to be pushed back by the various different Turkic peoples
who are moving into Anatolia. And then the story is being written
down as things are really becoming bleak, as that landscape is lost
and people begin to realize that that that territory, that empire is
gone forever. And so the stories, the epics like this one, and it's a
tradition, it's all they really have anymore. This is the thing that
becomes a symbol of who they are or rather who they were once upon a
time. That makes sense. So as I said at the beginning, is not really
read very often today, at least not in this part of the world. I
think there are three translations in English. This is the only one,
I think, of the Grotto Virata version. A couple of the shorter
versions are translated in English, and that's it. Three. And I think
the reason for that is because people are really looking for Homer,
they're looking for Virgil. They want this to read like one of these
classical epics. And it's not it's operating, as I said, within or
rather it's operating with these older traditions. But it's not
really a part of it. By this point. Everything has changed so much
that these old values, these old virtues, these old character types,
they just function differently. They can't exist in the business
world the way that they once had. And so this this cultural context
here really marks the transition from the ancient world, the ancient
epics, ancient societies that we've been reading about and discussing
into a more medieval form of society and of epic and. Any final
questions about the. Or ethics in general. All right, going to talk
about the final. That's why you guys showed up today, beginning the
final exam, but I posted the way that I didn't. Yes, I posted the
study guide and the examples of what the questions are going to look
like. Yes, they're there on the final and final exam info page. Check
those out. I do want to make a couple of notes here. It is the exact
same format as the midterm. It only covers information since the
midterm. So it's just the Roman and Roman epics. It does not include
anything Greek. If you want to reference something Greek, like in the
essay portion, you should feel perfectly free to do that. But I'm not
going to require it. Also, I noticed a lot of people leaving
something or leaving questions blank if they didn't know them on the
midterm. Don't do that. I give partial credit. Just don't leave
anything blank. If all you can think of is like bullet points, that's
fine. Just put something down half a point or one point is better
than literally nothing. Also, I give you guys minimum number of
sentences, like a minimum length of something that I'm looking for,
just barely writing. The minimum doesn't guarantee full credit. So,
for example, the essay portion, I think I wrote four to six sentences
as a minimum, but you also have like 20 minutes to write it. So if
you write those four sentences in five minutes, maybe keep going,
elaborate, use specific examples where where relevant more is always
better than less. Just in general on my tests from. All right, you
guys have any questions? But. These are also all online class
recordings, page PDF versions of. All right, I guess that doesn't
have a go on. Thank you for the semester. I never sought out advice
from.</p>
